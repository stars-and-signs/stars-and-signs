* Referee says what's at stake
* Protagonist takes an Action and makes a Check if the outcome is uncertain

## Actions & Results

* Actions describe the desired outcome
* When a protagonist takes an Action, they make a Check by rolling 2d10 plus an Ability die and a Skill modifier
* Difficulty is accounted for with Boons and Banes
* The total of the Check determines the degree of success or failure:
  * Less than 10 - Miss, the protagonist suffers Fallout
  * 10 to 14 - Graze, the protagonist must pay a Cost to succeed
  * 15 to 19 - Hit, the protagonist succeeds
  * 20 or greater - Critical Hit, the protagonistt succeeds and gets an Extra
* Regardless of degree of success, the referee uses a Complication

## Scale

* Scale is the limits of what is possible, it is not a measure of difficulty
* For example, you can't damage a tank with your bare fists
* You must match a challenge's Scale ratings to affect it
* Talents and Magic allow you to reach higher Scale
* The Scale of challenges can be lowered with teamwork or multiple Actions

## Resources and Consequences

* You have Hope and Effort, which you can spend to increase their odds of success
* You have a Despair Counter which fills as a common consequence for failure
* Despair mitigates your successes when filled and puts you into a critical state when filled
