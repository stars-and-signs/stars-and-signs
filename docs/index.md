Stars & Signs (S&S) is a tabletop role playing game about balancing struggles against evil and the struggles of daily life in a modern day setting. It is inspired by animated and live action series about transforming heroes.

S&S is the first iteration of a generic roleplaying game framework, called the Paradigm system. Paradigm is intended to balance fast, action-oriented and narrative first gameplay with mechanical depth and clear, actionable guidance.
