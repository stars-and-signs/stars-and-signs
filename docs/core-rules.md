# Basic Principles

* **Round up.** When a calculation results in a non-integer number, unless otherwise specified, round up to the higher nearest integer.  

# Dice, Boons, and Banes

This game relies on the use of a set of polyhedral dice that includes a: d0, d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12. Multiple die of the same size are often added together into a “dice pool”. When a dice pool is rolled, add all the dice together to get the result.

## **The Null Die (d0)**

The “d0” or “null die” is not a physical die that is rolled, like others. Instead, whenever you “roll” a d0, it results in a 0 unless it has one or more Boons or Banes. If a null die has one or more Boons, it produces 1\. Conversely, if it has one or more Banes, it results in \-1.

## **Boons**

A Boon represents some improvement to the result of a roll. Boons always apply to a specific die or dice pool. Boons are abbreviated “+1B” before specifying the die or dice pool they affect (e.g., “+1B Circumstance” or “+1B Ability”).

A die or dice pool can benefit from multiple Boons simultaneously (e.g. “+3B Circumstance”). A die or dice pool can benefit from up to five Boons at a time. Excess Boons are ignored.

When applying a Boon, add one additional die of the same type for each Boon applied. For example, when rolling 2d10 with \+2B becomes 4d10. The lowest dice are then dropped until only the original number of dice remain. The remaining dice are then totaled.

## **Banes**

Banes are the negative counterpart to Boons. It represents hindrances that worsen your odds of success. Banes are abbreviated as “-1B”. Like Boons, multiple Banes can be applied to the same die or dice. Only up to five Banes can apply to a single die or dice simultaneously.

When applying a Bane, add an extra die of the same type for each Bane applied. Roll the dice and drop the highest dice until only the original number of dice remain. Add the remaining dice together to get the total.

## **Boons and Banes Cancel**

If both Boons and Banes apply to the same die or dice pool, first subtract the number of Banes from the number of Boons and apply only the net amount. For example:

* \+3B Circumstance and \-1B Circumstance results in \+2B Circumstance, or roll 4d10 and take the highest two dice.  
* \+2B Circumstance and \-5B Circumstance results in \-3B Circumstance, or roll 5d10 and take the lowest two dice.  
* \+4B Circumstance and \-4B Circumstance results in \+0B Circumstance, or roll 2d10 and take the result.

# Actions

In Stars & Signs, every attempt to change the situation or act on opposition is an Action. Actions are defined by the intent behind them, not the methods used. Two protagonists might take different approaches \- violence, intimidation, or magical control \- but if their goals are the same, they’re taking the same Action type.

## **Declaring an Action**

When a player describes what their protagonist is aiming to accomplish, the referee identifies the Action type that best fits the intended outcome. If the referee’s interpretation doesn’t match the player’s intent, the two refine the description until they both agree on the Action’s purpose.

Intent determines Action type. The method of Execution determines the Ability and Skill.

## **Action Types**

Each of the nine Action types is intentionally broad. They exist to classify outcomes, not to describe actions or narrative.

### **Eliminate**

To remove an obstacle, neutralize a threat, destroy an object, or otherwise take something out of play. While this may appear to be the most direct route to overall success, opposition often needs to be weakened or edges need to be gained to be able to tackle difficult goals.

**Examples:** knock out a guard, disable an explosive device, smash a reinforced lock.

### **Hinder**

To weaken the opposition's ability to act or resist.

**Examples:** grapple a cultist, throw sand in someone’s face, psychologically unbalance a suspect.

### **Bolster**

To improve someone’s position, well-being, or readiness.

**Examples:** shielding a civilian, giving a rousing pep-talk, healing Wounds or Stress.

### **Influence**

To change beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors through force of personality, well-argued facts, or social pressure.

**Examples:** debating philosophy, intimidating a bully into believing you’re a threat, flattering a rival into cooperation.

### **Obscure**

To hide something \- facts, objects, intentions, or yourself.

**Examples:** lying convincingly, staying out of sight, concealing contraband on your person.

### **Create**

To construct, assemble, fashion, or generate something new and lasting.

**Examples:** forging a tool, designing a new magical ritual, building a friendship.

### **Utilize**

To make use of a resource, tool, connection, or edge already available.

**Examples:** accessing secured databases, calling in a favor, channeling energy from an artifact.

### **Discover**

To gather information not currently known.

**Examples:** researching an enemy, reading a room, tracking a missing person, analyzing mystical residue.

### **Transport**

To move a person, including yourself, or object through space under adverse conditions.

**Examples:** pulling an ally from danger, navigating a narrow cliffside, chasing down a suspect.

## **Action Type Triggers**

Features (Talents, Class Features, Charms, Assets, and others) often specify that they apply when a particular Action type is taken with a specific Skill. These appear as Action type (Skill). The Skill used determines the Ability that contributes the Ability die to the Action. For example:

* Eliminate (Violence) means using Might and Violence to Eliminate  
* Influence (Charisma) means using Confidence and Charisma to Influence  
* Transport (Agility) means using Grace and Agility to Transport

## **Determining the Ability and Skill Used**

After the Action type is established, the fictional method the protagonist is using determines which Ability and Skill apply. For example, two protagonists that want to Hinder a yokai:

* One protagonist throws a heavy object at its legs to trip it, they make a Might (Strength) check.  
* The other taunts it to break its concentration, they make a Guile (Manipulation) check.

Both are HInder Actions, but they use different Abilities and Skills based on the methods used.

## **Adjudicating Edge Cases**

Some situations fall between Action types. The referee should consider:

* Player intent  
* Consequences of success  
* Consequences of failure

Whichever Action type most accurately reflects the outcome is correct. When an Action would meaningfully accomplish more than one outcome, the referee may require separation Actions, or classify it by the dominant effect.

For example, setting off fireworks to distract guards while creating cover for allies:

* If the goal is to let allies pass unseen, the Action is Obscure.  
* If the goal is to unnerve and surprise the guard, the Action is Hinder.  
* If the fireworks serve as both, the referee may request multiple Actions for each objective.

# Checks

A Check is the fundamental resolution mechanic of Stars & Signs. Whenever a protagonist attempts something that could reasonably fail, they make a Check. Checks combine Circumstance dice, an Ability die, and any additional dice from Advantages or other features to produce a single numerical result. The result then determines failure or the degree of success.

## **When to Call for a Check**

The referee calls for a Check only when both of the following conditions apply:

1. There’s uncertainty. Success or failure is not guaranteed by common sense or narrative positioning.  
2. There’s repercussions. Failure matters and meaningfully alters the situation.

If the Action is trivial, rote, or unopposed, don’t roll. Conversely, if success is impossible, even under perfect execution, don’t roll.

## **Parts of a Check**

To construct the dice pool for a check:

1. Start with the Circumstance dice, which is 2d10  
2. Then add the most applicable Ability die and the protagonist’s modifier in the corresponding Skill, if any.  
3. Then add any additional dice or modifiers from Advantages and other features.  
4. Apply Boons and Banes to the corresponding dice then roll the pool. Apply the rules for Boons and Banes by dropping dice, as appropriate.  
5. Sum the remaining dice to get the result. The total is the Check’s result.

## **Interpreting the Result**

To determine if an Action is a failure or the degree of success, compare the Check’s total to the following fixed resolution bands.

### **Miss (\< 10\)**

The protagonist’s attempt fails. They do not achieve their goal cleanly and the referee applies Fallout. Fallout may:

* Block the goal outright, or  
* Allow partial success with a significant drawback

In addition to Fallout, the referee introduces a Complication.

### **Graze (10-14)**

The protagonist achieves their intent, but must pay a Cost to do so. There are three types of Costs: Personal, Impact, or Opportunity. The protagonist chooses the type of Cost they pay, but the referee determines its exact nature. Costs should never fully negate the benefits of a protagonist’s success.

The Cost types are:

* **Personal Costs.** The acting protagonist suffers Stress, loses access to an Asset, or one of their NPC relationships is damaged.  
* **Impact Costs.** The effects of the success are mitigated or delayed. If the Action would result in an Extra, it may be lost to fulfill this cost.  
* **Opportunity Costs.** The protagonist is put into a worse position, they potentially get a Temporary Negative Trait,  lose a Temporary Positive Trait, or increase the Stakes of the Action.

In addition to the Cost, the referee introduces a Complication.

### **Hit (15-19)**

The protagonist scores an unambiguous success. They accomplish what they set out to do without cost, but the referee still has an opportunity to introduce a Complication.

### **Critical Hit (20+)**

A superior success. The protagonist not only accomplishes their goal, their Action gains \+1 Scale. Scale improves the magnitude, reach, or durability of the result, depending on the context.

Unless the Critical Hit results in an Extra that skips it, the referee then introduces a Complication.

# Reactions & Tests

A Reaction occurs when a protagonist’s capabilities are being measured without them performing an Action. In other words, a Reaction is invoked when the world exerts pressure on the protagonist and they must endure, notice, recall, or maintain something rather than proactively attempting to change the situation. Reactions are resolved using Tests.

## **Reaction Types**

A Reaction belongs to one of the following types.

### **Resist**

When a protagonist is resisting some influence under the referee’s control. This includes physical danger or mental and social coercion.

Examples: A cultist strikes you with a club, a demon attempts to dominate your will, a bully tries to intimidate you, toxic miasma chokes you.

### **Notice**

When a protagonist’s senses or intuition are being tested.

Examples: Spotting a hidden figure watching from the rafters, sensing a shift in someone’s mood, or realizing a story doesn’t add up.

### **Remember**

When a protagonist attempts to recall information.

Examples: Recognizing a symbol of an obscure sect, remembering the weakness of a monster chasing you, or recalling a legend relevant to the situation.

### **Sustain**

When a protagonist is maintaining something, such as an effect or an extended effort.

Examples: keep a summoned entity under control, hold concentration under duress, maintain a grapple.

### **Support**

When a protagonist is participating in a Cooperation Check as a Follower.

Examples: stealthing as a group, working together to lift a heavy object, performing a group ritual.

### **Recover**

When a protagonist is attempting to recover from a Wounds.

## **Tests**

A Test is used to determine if a protagonist’s Reaction succeeds or fails. Unlike Checks, where players roll dice, Tests are resolved using a Difficulty roll made by the referee.

### **Difficulty Rolls**

To perform a Test, the referee rolls Difficulty dice, which is 2d10. The result is then compared against the protagonist’s most relevant Skill’s Reaction score, determined by the nature of the Reaction. If the Difficulty roll is equal to or greater than the Reaction score, the protagonist fails. Otherwise, the protagonist succeeds.

Tests are binary \- there are no partial successes, Costs, or Criticals for Tests.

### **Reaction Scores**

A protagonist’s Reaction Score for a Test depends on their ranks in the most relevant Skill and their ranks in the corresponding Ability. It is calculated using the following formula (rounding up the final result):

10+Ability rank \+ Skill rank2

### **Open or Secret Tests**

The referee may choose to roll Difficulty in secret when the protagonist should not immediately know whether they succeeded or failed, or even if a Test occurred at all.

# Cooperation

When two or more protagonists attempt something together and the entire group will either succeed or fail as a unit, they perform a Cooperation Check. A Cooperation Check has three steps:

1. Choose a Leader  
2. Followers choose their method of supporting and make a Test  
3. The Leader makes a Check to determine the group’s success, with modifiers from the Follower’s outcomes

## **Leader**

The group designates one protagonist as the Leader, which identifies whose Check will determine the group’s collective outcome.

The Leader is responsible for:

* Describing the group’s shared intent as a single Action  
* Determining the method they personally use  
* Making the final Check  
* Choosing Cost types and distributing the effects of Fallout, if appropriate

## **Followers**

All other participants in a Cooperation Check become Followers. Each Follower describes how they’re helping the group’s efforts.

Once  their method is chosen, each Follower makes a Support Test. Each Follower that succeeds grants \+2 to the Leader’s Check. Each Follower that fails grants \-2 to the Leader’s Check.

## **Collective Check**

After the Followers have made their Tests and the cumulative Cooperation modifier is calculated, the Leader makes a Check, as normal, adding the Cooperation modifier to the result.

## **Shared Fallout**

Cooperation spreads both benefits and risks. If the Leader’s Check results in:

* Each member of the group pays any Costs or suffers any Fallout.  
* The referee uses one Complication for the whole group.

# Scale

Scale is an abstract measure of what a protagonist is capable of accomplishing given their narrative positioning, tools, and features. It applies to Actions, Reactions, and challenges. Scale defines the order of magnitude of what is possible. It does not describe the mere relative difficulty of a given task.

## **Scale Ratting**

Scale ranges from 0 to 5\. By default, all Actions and Reactions are Scale 0 unless a feature or Asset explicitly increases them or there is narrative justification for a higher Scale.

* The default Scale of a protagonist’s Actions and Reactions is Scale 0 \- everyday human capabilities.  
* Scale 1 is what a normal person could accomplish with simple tools or luck.  
* Scale 2 is beyond what an unequipped person could accomplish purely with luck. Some sort of specialized Asset, magic, or fictional positioning is necessary.  
* Scale 3 is beyond normal human technology and capabilities. Only highly advanced equipment, such as an entire factory or military weapons, or magic can achieve Scale 3\.  
* Scale 4 is far beyond what a mundane human can accomplish and, even with highly specialized equipment, can only be achieved with luck. Even with magic, a protagonist must exert themselves to reach Scale 4\.  
* Scale 5 is the absolute apex of what can be accomplished by a protagonist. Scale 5 can be reached only with a combination of powerful magic and luck.

Examples of tasks at each Scale are provided later in the Skills Description section.

## **Scale Factors**

Scale is a composite of four underlying factors. The Scale of an Action or challenge may derive primarily from one of these factors or a combination of multiple. It is not important to assign an exact value to each of these, as they simply guide the referee to determining the overall Scale.

* **Potency.** How forceful, destructive, influential, or impactful the outcome is. Lifting a car has a higher Scale than lifting moving boxes due to the potency.  
* **Speed.** How rapidly the outcome can be achieved. Chasing down a car has a higher Scale than chasing down a culprit on foot due to speed.  
* **Duration.** How long the outcome lasts. Restraining a rampaging beast for an hour is higher Scale than doing so for a moment due to Duration.  
* **Scope.** The breadth of the outcome in terms of range, area of effect, or number of targets. Magically healing an entire group is higher Scale than doing so for an individual due to scope.

## **Required Scale**

An Action or Reaction cannot overcome a challenge with a higher Scale. For example, a Scale 0 unarmed strike cannot meaningfully harm a Scale 3 armored vehicle.

If a Scale gap makes an Action impossible, the referee should plainly state so instead of calling for a Check.

## **Critical Hit Scale Increase**

Whenever a protagonist scores a Critical Hit (gets a result of 20 or greater on a Check), they gain \+1 Scale on that Action. This bonus can apply only once per check and only to that specific attempt. This might allow the protagonist to achieve greater feats than typical due to luck.

## **Excess Scale**

If a protagonist succeeds on an Action (the result of their check is at least 10\) and that Action’s Scale exceeds the Scale of the challenge, they gain an Extra. Excess Scale grants only one Extra per check, regardless of the size of the difference.

# Extras

Protagonists may gain one or more Extras for a successful Action from features or Critical Hits. Extras represent “above and beyond” outcomes \- additional impact, expanded effect, or secondary benefits that flow naturally from superior force, speed, duration, or scope.

Extras are flexible in what they represent, but they can be thought of in terms of increasing one of the Scale factors:

* The protagonist rolls an additional d10 when determining the amount of points they earn towards a Counter (Potency).  
* The protagonist creates a Trait in addition to accomplishing their goal (Potency).  
* Additional targets are affected (Scope).  
* The task is accomplished faster than expected (Speed).  
* The referee skips using a Complication (Speed).  
* The effects of success are longer lasting or permanent instead of temporary (Duration).  
* A resulting Trait has an additional free invoke (Duration).

The referee determines the exact nature of an Extra, but some features may give players effects they may choose to convert their Extras into.

# Traits

Traits are short, descriptive statements attached to a character, location, object, scene, or concept.

## **Trait Duration**

Traits exist in two forms: Temporary or Permanent.

Temporary Traits are created by Actions or circumstance. They persist until something in the fiction negates or resolves them. They often represent situational advantages, imposed conditions, or transient states. Examples include: \[Pinned Under Rubble\], \[Distracted\], \[Illuminated by a Spotlight\].

Permanent Traits represent inherent, defining qualities. They persist unless explicitly removed or altered.

## **Trait Alignment**

Each Trait has an alignment that governs how it influences checks. Traits can be Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

### **Neutral Traits**

Neutral Traits have no inherent mechanical bonuses or penalties but they may be invoked or compelled.

### **Positive Traits**

Actions and Reactions relevant to a Positive Trait gain \+1B Circumstance (for Checks) or \-1B Difficulty (for Tests). A Positive Trait may still be invoked or compelled.

### **Negative Traits**

Actions and Reactions relevant to a Negative Trait suffer \-1B Circumstance (for Checks) or \+1B Difficulty (for Tests). A Negative Trait may still be invoked in rare circumstances where it can be turned to a protagonist’s advantage.

## **Invoking Traits**

Invoking Traits is the primary way that protagonists convert their narrative positioning into mechanical leverage. When a protagonist performs an Action or Reaction related to a Trait, they may invoke that Trait by spending 1 Hope.

When a protagonist invokes a Trait, they choose one of the following benefits:

* **Circumstance Boon.** \+1B Circumstance on the Check. This option must be chosen before the Check is made.  
* **Advantage Die.** The protagonist adds an additional d10 to their result, called an Advantage die. This option can only be chosen after the Check is made and only if the Check was a success (a result of at least 10). If the protagonist already has an Advantage die for the Check (such as from another invoked Trait), they instead gain \+1B Advantage. This option may be chosen before or after the Check is rolled.

Any number of different relevant Traits may be invoked on the same Check but a Trait may be invoked up to once per Check

## **Free Invokes**

Some Positive or Neutral Traits possess free invokes, which protagonists can expend instead of Hope to invoke that Trait. Each free invoke allows one invocation of the Trait without cost.

## **Compelling Traits**

A protagonist may compel a Trait to regain 1 Hope. To compel a Trait, a protagonist must take an Action or make a choice that significantly complicates their situation. The complication must be meaningful enough to merit Fallout from the referee and the Trait must reasonably justify the complication.

## **Creating Traits**

Protagonists often create Temporary Traits through successful Actions during play. Traits created this way are Neutral and come with one free invoke, which the creating protagonist may use or give to any other protagonist.

Many features enhance created Triats by adding extra free invokes, granting additional effects when invoked, or upgrading their alignment to Positive.

# Counters

Counters are a structured method for tracking progress towards an evolving outcome, such as accumulating successes or threats advancing towards failure. Counters make complicated, multi-step situations more manageable.

## **Points and Slots**

Counters are comprised of one to ten “slots”. Each slot is worth 5 points. Whenever points are assigned to a Counter, fill slots until no points remain. Even if only a single point remains, the entire slot must be filled. For example, if you gain 7 points towards a Counter, fill two slots.

When the last slot is filled, a Counter is completed. The repercussions of which depend on the Counter.

Often, points towards a Counter will be determined by rolling one or more d10s.

## **Counter Types**

### **Progress**

Used when achieving a goal requires multiple successful contributions toward the same challenge. Examples:

* Eliminating a major foe through combat  
* Disabling a complex security system  
* Completing a magical ritual

### **Danger**

Used when a threat, hazard, or opposition is emerging or advancing toward a minor goal. The goal would meaningfully worsen the situation, but not outright preclude the protagonist’s objectives. Examples:

* Hostile creatures closing in on the protagonists’ location  
* Cultists summoning a powerful demon  
* Pursuing foes narrowing the gap in a chase

### **Defeat**

Used to measure the protagonists’ proximity to a major failure that isn’t tied to personal harm. When a Defeat Counter fills, something crucial is lost. Examples:

* Fire consuming a protagonist’s home  
* An artifact being corrupted beyond repair  
* Cultists summoning a world-ending demon

### **Resource**

Used to track finite resources that diminish with use. When a Resource Counter fills, whatever it corresponds to is depleted. Examples:

* Ammunition  
* Magical energy  
* Favors and reputation

### **Timer**

Similar to a Danger or Defeat Counter but measures the approach of a neutral event. Timer Counters typically advance whenever a protagonist takes an Action, regardless of success or failure. For example, measuring the amount of time left in a Flashback.

# Abilities

Every protagonist’s capabilities are defined by their nine Abilities. Each Ability captures a broad mode of capability.

Abilities are grouped into three categories \- Physical, Mental, and Emotional. These categories matter for certain features.

The nine Abilities are:

**Physical**

* **Might.** Force, raw strength, and physical speed.  
* **Grace.** Balance, precision, reflexes, and finesse.  
* **Endurance.** Stamina, toughness, and health.

**Mental**

* **Intellect.** Analysis, knowledge, problem-solving, and technical skills.  
* **Cunning.** Cleverness, improvisation, and trickery.  
* **Will.** Mental resilience, patience, focus, and studiousness.

**Emotional**

* **Confidence.** Presence, likability, assertiveness, and bold projection.  
* **Guile.** Misdirection, emotional manipulation, and decorum.  
* **Empathy.** Sensitivity, compassion, and emotional insight.

## **Ability Ranks**

Each protagonist has a rank of 1 to 10 in each of the nine Abilities. Protagonists can increase their ranks in Abilities with Talents.

## **Ability Die**

An Ability’s rank determines the Ability die added to Checks that use that Ability:

| Ability Rank | Ability Die |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | d0 |
| 2-3 | d4 |
| 4-5 | d6 |
| 6-7 | d8 |
| 8-9 | d10 |
| 10 | d12 |

Like Circumstance dice, features can grant Boons and Banes to Ability die when making Checks that use that die.

# Skills

While Abilities represent more broad aptitudes in groupings of tasks, Skills represent more specific, practiced competencies. Skills describe the approach you’re taking to an Action.

Every Ability has three associated Skills, giving each protagonist a total of 27 Skills.

## **Skill Ranks**

Each protagonist starts with 0 ranks in every Skill unless they gain ranks in that Skill during protagonist creation. Ranks may be increased at Major Milestones by spending Skill Points (SP).

## **Skill Modifiers**

A Skill’s rank determines its modifier, which is added to the result of a Check that uses that Skill.

| Skill Rank | Skill Modifier |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | \+0 |
| 1-2 | \+1 |
| 3-4 | \+2 |
| 5-6 | \+3 |
| 7-8 | \+4 |
| 9-10 | \+5 |

Up to one Skill modifier may be added to a Check at a time.

## **Compelling**

Protagonists may compel their Skills, similar to Traits, to regain Effort (see Effort). Compelling a Skill requires acting in a way that meaningfully complicates their life.

When a protagonist compels a Skill, they regain an amount of Effort of the corresponding type equal to their modifier in that Skill.

Examples:

* A highly knowledgeable analyst compelling Logic to overthink a simple situation.  
* A trained soldier compelling Violence to not back down from a duel.  
* A sensitive therapist compelling Insight to become overwhelmed by other’s emotions.

## **Skill Descriptions**

### **Might**

* **Strength.** Lift or haul heavy objects or wrestle with creatures.  
* **Violence.** Physically harm creatures and objects using any means.  
* **Agility.** Run, climb, swim, or otherwise move your body with speed and force.

### **Grace**

* **Acrobatics.** Dodge, tumble, balance, squeeze; move with precision.  
* **Dexterity.** Manipulate small or complex objects with your hands.  
* **Stealth.** Hide and sneak.

### **Endurance**

* **Defense.** Protect yourself and others from harm.  
* **Stamina.** Perform prolonged actions.  
* **Vitality.** Exhibit good health.

### **Intellect**

* **Logic.** Understand complex systems and solve problems.  
* **Memory.** Recall facts and employ that knowledge.  
* **Rhetoric.** Make logical arguments and educate others.

### **Cunning**

* **Awareness.** Search and notice.  
* **Interfacing.** Use advanced technology and complex devices.  
* **Savvy.** Understand pop culture, use street smarts, and common sense.

### **Will**

* **Craft.** Build and repair things.  
* **Research.** Learn new things.  
* **Resolve.** Have patience, resist mental manipulation, and exhibit courage.

### **Confidence**

* **Authority.** Intimidate or lead through force of personality.  
* **Charisma.** Charm, seduce, or endear.  
* **Intuition.** Listen to your gut and create art.

### **Guile**

* **Deception.** Lie or impersonate.   
* **Diplomacy.** Broker deals, exhibit good manners, speak eloquently.  
* **Manipulation.** Emotionally control, gaslight, bully.

### **Empathy**

* **Insight.** Understand other’s feelings and personality.  
* **Networking.** Build, leverage, and repair long-term relationships and reputations.   
* **Therapy.** Heal other’s bodies and minds.

# Effort

Effort represents a protagonist’s capacity to push themselves beyond their normal limits \- physical exertion, mental strain, or emotional resolve. It is a finite resource stored in three point pools, corresponding to the three Ability categories.

## **Effort Types**

Each protagonist has three Effort pools:

* **Blood.** Tied to Physical Abilities (Might, Grace, Endurance)  
* **Sweat.** Tied to Mental Abilities (Intellect, Cunning, Will)  
* **Tears.** Tied to Emotional Abilities (Confidence, Guile, Empathy)

## **Spending Effort**

When a protagonist makes a Check, after seeing the result, they may spend up to 5 Effort from the pool associated with the Ability used for that check. For each point of Effort spent, the protagonist gains \+1 to that Check’s result.

## **Regaining and Refreshing Effort**

The maximum number of points a protagonist can have in each of their Effort pools is determined by the protagonist’s ranks in the associated Abilities. This number is referred to as their Refresh. For example, a protagonist with 5 ranks in Might, 4 ranks in Grace, and 2 ranks in Endurance has 11 Blood Refresh.

Protagonists regain Effort by compelling Skills, as described in the Skills section.

At each Major Milestone, a protagonist’s Effort resets to the corresponding Refresh value. Protagonists 

## **Gaining Skill Points**

Whenever a protagonist regains Effort through either a Skill compel or Refresh, they also gain an equal number of Skill Points (SP).

# Hope

Hope is an abstract representation of what makes a protagonist truly special: their courage, optimism, and conviction. Hope fuels Trait invocations and certain features.

## **Spending Hope**

Protagonists can spend Hope to invoke Traits. Some features provide additional uses for Hope. Hope can also be spent to decrease a protagonist’s Despair (see Despair).

## **Refreshing and Regaining Hope**

Each protagonist has a pool of 5 Hope points, which is their Hope Refresh. At each Major Milestone, a protagonist resets their number of Hope points to their Hope Refresh. Protagonists can also regain Hope by compelling Traits.

Protagonists may increase their Hope Refresh by gaining Negative Connections to other protagonists.

# Protagonist Traits

Protagonist Traits define who they are as a character beyond their Abilities and Skills. They shape their identity, relationships, motivations, and even how they remain grounded. Traits regularly evolve throughout play alongside the protagonist’s personal journey.

Protagonist Traits come in several forms:

* **Aspects.** Identity-defining attributes.  
* **Connections.** Bonds between protagonists.  
* **Agendas.** Motivations and personal goals.  
* **Anchors.** What grounds the protagonist.  
* **Affinities.** Finer specializations.

## **Aspects**

Each protagonist has three Aspects, which are assigned at creation. Aspects are Permanent, Neutral Traits that express core truths about the character. The three Aspects are:

* **Mask.** How the protagonist presents themselves or how they are perceived. Masks reflect public identity, self-image, persona, and general reputation.  
* **Heart.** What the protagonist holds most dear or who they truly are, their passions and authentic self.  
* **Shadow.** The part of the protagonist that they hide or suppress: fears, resentment, inconvenient desire, weaknesses, or dangerous impulses.

### **Compelling Aspects**

The referee may attempt to compel a protagonist’s Aspects. This works like a typical Trait compel, but the protagonist’s player may refuse the offered compel. If they refuse, they gain 1d10 Corruption.

### **Advancing Aspects**

When an Aspect advances (see Advancement), they gain one rank in a Magical Affinity of their choice.

## **Connections**

A Connection is a Permanent Neutral Trait describing the relationship between one protagonist and another. All protagonists begin play with a Connection to each other protagonist.

Connections may be Positive, Negative, or Neutral Traits.

### **Bonus Hope Refresh**

A protagonist’s Hope Refresh increases by 1 for each Negative Connection they have to other protagonists, to a maximum of 10 Hope Refresh.

Protagonists do not benefit from Negative Connections to non-protagonist characters.

### **Advancing Connections**

When a Connection advances, the protagonist gains \+1 Affinity to the target of that Connection.

The alignment of the Connection changes based on the Memories associated with that advancement (see Advancement).

* If the memories are mostly positive, the Connection moves one step towards Positive (a Negative Connection becomes Neutral; a Neutral Connection becomes Positive).  
* If the memories are mostly negative, the Connection moves one step towards Negative (a Positive Connection becomes Neutral; a Neutral Connection becomes Negative).  
* If the memories are mostly neutral or there is an equal mix, the Connection remains unchanged.

## **Agendas**

Agendas are Permanent Neutral Traits representing a protagonist’s personal goals. Agendas may be specific or broad personal priorities that drive action.

Each protagonist starts with two Agendas.

### **Gaining Agendas**

At each Major Milestone, a protagonist may create a new Agenda. A protagonist may have a maximum of five Agendas at any one time.

### **Advancing Agendas**

When an Agenda advances, the protagonist may choose one of the following benefits:

* The protagonist gains one rank in an Affinity related to the goal of that Agenda. The Affinity may be chosen from any Affinity list except Conviction or Tendency.  
* The protagonist gains a new Anchor related to the Agenda.  
* The protagonist clears a Lingering Wound. Only choose this option if the Agenda was dedicated to clearing that Lingering Wound.

### **Completing Agendas**

Unlike Aspects or Connections, Agendas often reach clear narrative conclusions. If an Agenda concludes before all its Memory slots are filled, the remaining Memories may represent the narrative and emotional aftermath or consequences of the Agenda’s resolution.

For example, a protagonist searching for their missing parents finds them, but two Memory slots remain. These slots could be filled by processing the reunion or grappling with the unresolved emotions this reunion entails.

## **Anchors**

Anchors are Permanent Neutral Traits that keep a protagonist grounded and tethered to the mundane world, for good or for ill. They can be leveraged to counterbalance the seductive pull of magic, trauma, and dwindling will.

Anchors must not be magical in nature. Common Anchors include:

* Significant relationships with non-protagonist characters (platonic, familial, romantic, complicated, or antagonistic)  
* Membership in a club, workplace, team, community group, or gang.  
* Meaningful activities, hobbies, belief systems, or long-term commitments.

### **Gaining Anchors**

Protagonists start the game with two Anchors. They may also transform an Agenda into an Anchor when they advance that Agenda.

A protagonist may have up to five Anchors at any time. If they would gain a sixth Anchor, they must choose an Anchor to give up. Any Memories that would be lost due to this are moved to the new Anchor.

### **Clearing Corruption**

When a protagonist compels an Anchor, they may choose to gain 1 Hope as normal or instead clear 1 Corruption slot.

### **Flashbacks**

Once per Major Milestone, a protagonist may initiate a Flashback related to one of their Anchors. This does not require an Action.

When initiating a Flashback, the protagonist proposes a topic, mood, or theme related to that Anchor. The referee then frames a short scene depicting a meaningful moment between the protagonist and their Anchor in the past.

At the completion of the Flashback, the protagonist clears up to five filled Corruption slots.

## **Affinities**

Affinities are Permanent Neutral Traits representing a protagonist’s mundane or magical specializations, specific knowledge, and training. They are more specific than Skills, referring to specific subjects or courses of action.

A protagonist may have any number of Affinities and they gain a variable number at protagonist creation. They also gain them from various sources throughout play.

### **Affinity Ranks**

Unlike other Traits, a protagonist can gain the same Affinity multiple times. When a protagonist gains an Affinity, they gain a rank in it. For example, when a protagonist gains their first rank in Science Affinity, their rank in Science is 1\. If they were to gain Science Affinity again, they would become rank 2\. 

### **Free Invokes**

Protagonists gain 1 free invokes for an Affinity at ranks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\.

| Affinity Rank | Free Invokes |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | 0 |
| 2-3 | 1 |
| 4-5 | 2 |
| 6-7 | 3 |
| 8-9 | 4 |
| 10 | 5 |

Protagonists refresh their free Affinity invokes at each Minor Milestone.

# Despair

Despair represents the physical strain, psychological pressure, and emotional exhaustion a protagonist accumulates during their adventures. It is their primary damage track. A protagonist is not directly injured as they accumulate Despair, but it pushes them towards harmful states and may eventually lead to lasting Wounds.

Each protagonist has a 10 slot Despair Counter. Whenever they suffer Despair, they must either absorb it with a combination of Despair and Moods.

## **Clearing Despair**

Filled Despair slots may be cleared in several ways. At a Major Milestone, each protagonist clears all filled Despair slots. At a Minor Milestone, a protagonist may spend any number of their Hope points to clear one Despair slot per point of Hope spent (no Action required).

In addition, a protagonist may use a Bolster Action to attempt to relieve the Despair of another protagonist. On a success, the protagonist clears filled slots worth up to 1d10 Despair.

## **Fragile State**

When a protagonist fills their fifth Despair slot, they become Fragile. While Fragile, the results of a protagonist’s successes are mitigated. Critical Hits become Hits, Hits become Grazes, and Grazes become Misses.

## **Broken State**

When a protagonist fills their tenth Despair slot, they become Broken. While Broken, a protagonist suffers three effects.

### **Greater Mitigation**

The protagonist’s successes are further mitigated. Critical Hits become Grazes and all other results become Misses.

### **Hopelessness**

The protagonist is unable to spend Hope for any purpose, including to clear Despair at Minor Milestones.

A Broken protagonist may be rescued by having an ally compel their Connection to the Broken protagonist and giving up the Hope they would receive. In exchange, the Broken protagonist clears 5 of their filled Despair slots.

### **Vulnerability**

If a Broken protagonist would suffer Despair, they instead gain one Wound for each Despair slot they would have filled. For example, a Broken protagonist suffering 8 Despair suffers 2 Wounds.

# Wounds

Wounds represent the lasting repercussions of a protagonist reaching a breaking point, or suffering a lasting injury, trauma, or indignity. Unlike Despair or Moods, which model immediate strain, Wounds track enduring consequences.

Wounds are Temporary Negative Traits that apply a \-1B Circumstance penalty to all Checks using Abilities of the same category as the Wound. Wounds come in three types: Physical, Mental, or Social.

Wounds remain until they are cleared or they escalate into a Lingering Wound.

## **Suffering Wounds**

Wounds occur when suffering Despair while Broken or when suffering Fallout while taking an Action with high Stakes.

## **Recovery**

Wounds can be cleared with time and effort. At each Minor Milestone, each protagonist may attempt to clear one Wound of their choice by taking a Reaction with a Test corresponding to the Wound type:

* Physical Wounds \- Recovery (Vitality) Test  
* Mental Wounds \- Recovery (Resolve) Test  
* Social Wounds \- Recovery (Networking) Test

Failure does not confer any additional negative consequences besides missing the opportunity to clear a Wound.

Protagonists may also attempt to clear a Wound from themselves or allies by taking a Bolster Action. Physical and Mental Wounds can be cleared with a successful Bolster (Therapy) Check while Social Wounds can be cleared with a successful Bolster (Networking) Check.

## **Defeat**

A protagonist can suffer up to five Wounds total simultaneously. If a protagonist would exceed five Wounds, they are Defeated. Upon Defeat, the protagonist’s player chooses one of the following outcomes

### **Retirement**

The protagonist becomes unable to continue adventuring. They exit play and become a non-protagonist character under the referee’s control.

The story acknowledges their exit: disability, trauma, obligation, transformation, exile; whatever fits the fiction.

The player creates a new protagonist introduced at the next appropriate moment.

### **Vanishing**

The protagonist is lost completely and is functionally removed from the story. This may represent death, institutionalization, being abducted by monsters, fleeing the city after severe bullying, or being trapped or sealed away.

A vanished protagonist does not return unless both the referee and player explicitly agree.

### **Lingering Wound**

Instead of removal from the story, the protagonist may choose to gain a Lingering Wound, which is a Permanent Negative Trait. It matches the category of the last Wound received (Physical, Mental, or Emotional) before Defeat. The referee determines the specific narrative expression of this Trait.

Upon gaining the Lingering Wound, the protagonist is removed from the current scenario and returns at the next narrative opportunity or Minor Milestone. All non-Lingering Wounds the protagonist has of the same type as the Lingering Wound are cleared.

Lingering Wounds cannot be removed like ordinary Wounds. Instead, a protagonist can replace Reflecting on an Agenda during a Minor Milestone with Reflection on Recovering from their Wound. Upon the Lingering Wound gaining a third Memory, it is cleared.

# Moods

Moods are temporary states reflecting acute emotional or psychological instability. Each MOod corresponds to one Ability. Entering a Mood reduces incoming Despair at the cost of dramatically weakening that Ability for a time.

A protagonist may be in up to two Moods at any one time. They may not enter a third Mood until one is cleared.

## **Absorbing Despair with Moods**

When a protagonist suffers Despair, they may enter up to two Moods, each reducing Despair by an amount equal to their rank in the Ability associated with that Mood. This cannot reduce the amount of Despair received below 0\.

For example, a protagonist with Might 6 that enters the Weary Mood reduces the incoming Despair by 6\. Any remaining Despair must be absorbed with Despair slots.

## **Effects of Moods**

While in a Mood, the protagonist’s associated Ability is impaired. While making Checks using the associated Ability, the protagonist does not add their Ability die or Skill modifier to the Check. The protagonist still benefits from Circumstance Boons and Advantage die.

When making a Test while in a Mood, the protagonist’s Reaction score for the Skills associated with that Ability becomes 5\.

## **Ending Moods**

A protagonist may end a Mood they’re in by compelling it. To compel a Mood, the protagonist “leans into” it. Like other compels, this behavior must meaningfully worsen the situation. Once compelled, the Mood immediately ends.

Unlike compelling a Trait, Mood compels do not regain Hope.

## **Mood Descriptions**

### **Weary (Might)**

Drained, depleted, physically and spiritually exhausted.

Example compels: dropping something heavy, staggering, fainting, needing a nap.

### **Nervous (Grace)**

Jittery, unsteady, shaky, overly cautious.

Example compels: fumbling an object, hesitating at the wrong moment, misstepping.

### **Sensitive (Endurance)**

Fragile, raw, emotionally thin-skinned, near breaking.

Example compels: crying, lashing out, taking offense at nothing.

### **Obstinate (Intellect)**

Closed-minded, stubborn, refusing logic or analysis.

Example compels: dismissing a workable plan, refusing to consider evidence, making emotional arguments when facts are needed.

### **Distracted (Cunning)**

Unfocused, oblivious, preoccupied by obsessive thoughts.

Example compels: ignoring something vital, fixating on irrelevant detail, reacting too slow.

### **Reckless (Will)**

Impulsive, overcommitted, heedless of danger.

Example compels: taking an unnecessary risk, diving in without preparation.

### **Insecure (Confidence)**

Unsure, timid, fading into the background, losing assertiveness.

Example compels: yielding the spotlight, refusing to speak up, freezing with stage fright.

### **Irritated (Guile)**

Impatient, blunt, unable to maintain subtlety or deception.

Example compels: snapping at someone, revealing too much, seething with rage

### **Sullen (Empathy)**

Withdrawn, numb, shut down emotionally.

Example compels: pulling away from others, refusing emotional connection.

# Corruption

Corruption represents spiritual erosion, magical contamination, and a loss of free will that threatens protagonists wielding magic.

Each protagonist has a Corruption Counter with 10 slots, each slot is worth 5 Corruption. Protagonists gain Corruption by using magic or by refusing Aspect compels.

## **Reducing Corruption**

Protagonists can reduce their Corruption by compelling an Anchor. Whenever a protagonist compels an Anchor, instead of regaining Hope, they may clear one Corruption slot.

## **Effects of Corruption**

Gaining Corruption has no impact during a session. Instead, it only begins to impact protagonists after Milestones.

The referee gets a Temptation for each protagonist that reaches a Minor Milestone with at least 5 filled Corruption slots.

For each protagonist that reaches a Major Milestone with at least 1 filled Corruption slot, the referee gains a Corruption Fallout which they can use against that protagonist before the next Major Milestone. The severity of this Corruption Fallout depends on the level of Corruption. It may be Minor, Major, or Severe.

The Referee Guide has more information about using Temptations and Corruption Fallout against protagonists.

## **Consumed**

A protagonist that gains Corruption while already having 10 filled Corruption slot becomes Consumed until the next Minor Milestone, at which point they choose one of the following options. Once they choose an option, they clear 5 filled Corruption slots.

### **Burn Anchor**

The protagonist permanently loses one of their Anchors. At the next narrative opportunity, or via a Flashback, the referee and player reveal how that tie was destroyed. If a protagonist would lose the final Anchor in this way, they cannot choose this option.

### **Drain Memories**

The protagonist chooses five Memories from among their Aspects, Connections, or Agendas. They lose each chosen Memory. The protagonist cannot choose this option if they do not have at least five Memories amongst their Traits.

### **Dramatic Confrontation**

The protagonist’s Corruption erupts violently. The remaining protagonists face opposition with a 10-slot Progress Counter.

If the group overcomes this opposition, the Consumed protagonist is saved and their Temptation points are lost.

If the remaining protagonists yield or are Defeated, the Consumed protagonist must choose the Fall to Darkness option instead.

### **Fall to Darkness**

The protagonist is lost. They are retired (as if Defeated) but they become a Signbearer under the referee’s control. They may create a new protagonist at the next Minor Milestone.

# Assets

Assets are tools, implements, relationships, or leverage that empowers protagonists to act more effectively. An Asset may be a physical object (a bat, a cellphone), social leverage (blackmail, membership in a club, a title of honor), or an independent ally. Regardless of form, Assets provide mechanical benefits through their Functions.

A protagonist may apply up to one of their Assets when they use it to perform one of its Functions. When a protagonist uses an Asset for an Action, they can choose one of the following benefits:

* **Upgrade Ability die.** The protagonist may upgrade the size of their Ability die for the check to match that of the Quality die for the Asset used.  
* **Asset bonus.** The protagonist adds the Asset’s Quality rating directly to the check’s result.

The protagonist must declare which benefit they’re choosing before making the roll.

## **Functions**

Each Asset has a set of Functions for which it is suitable to be used. Each Function essentially serves as an independent Asset, capable of having different Quality ratings, Scales, and other properties.

## **Quality**

The Functions of an Asset have Quality ratings ranging from 0 to 5\. The Quality of an Asset’s Function determines the bonus or size of the Quality die.

| Quality Rating | Quality Die | Quality Bonus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | d0 | 0 |
| 1 | d4 | 1 |
| 2 | d6 | 2 |
| 3 | d8 | 3 |
| 4 | d10 | 4 |
| 5 | d12 | 5 |

Most Assets have a Quality of 1 or better. When used for something other than one of its Functions, an Asset is treated as having a Quality of 0\.

## **Asset Scale**

Assets may upgrade the Scale of Actions and Reactions made using them. This upgraded Scale may allow a protagonist to overcome challenges outside of what they could normally achieve.

For example, a mundane Baseball Bat grants Scale 1 for Eliminate (Violence) but a Magical Sword, even while wielded by a normal human, offers Scale 3 Eliminate (Violence).

## **Asset Types**

Asset types are descriptive tags used for classification, narrative clarity, and interactions with Talents, Perks, and other features.

Common types of Assets with examples include:

* **Weapons.** Blades, bats, and firearms. Weapons are used to harm things. All Weapon Assets can be used for Eliminate (Violence) or Hinder (Violence).  
* **Armor.** Bulletproof vests, riot shields, plate mail, and magical barriers. All Armor Assets can be used for Bolster (Defense).   
* **Leverage.** Blackmail, favors, and bribes. Leverage can be used for Influence Actions using one or more Skills.  
* **Vehicles.** Bikes, running shoes, cars, mechs, and trains. Vehicles are used for Traverse Actions.  
* **References.** Books, libraries, and informants. References are used for Discover Actions.  
* **Materials.** Raw components, damaged objects, and power tools. Materials are used for Create (Craft) Actions.  
* **Obstructions.** Barriers and hiding spots. Obstructions are used to Obscure (Stealth) or Bolster (Defense).  
* **Gadgets.** Technological devices such as cellphones, tablets, and computers. Gadgets are used to Discover, Influence, and Create.  
* **Tools.** A catch-all that describes Assets used for physical tasks such as lock-picks, grappling hooks, and battering rams.  
* **Allies.**  
* **Relics.**  
* **Regalia.**

## **Inventory**

For each Asset type, a protagonist can possess up to two Assets of that type at a time. Some protagonist features or Asset properties may affect this carry capacity. Protagonists can swap the Assets they’re carrying at narrative opportunities.

## **Asset Properties**

Some Assets possess additional mechanical traits. These properties can apply to either the Asset itself or specific Functions of that Asset.

### **Impactful**

An Impactful Function improves progress towards a specified task that requires a Progress Counter. When a protagonist rolls for Progress for that task, they add the Asset’s Quality to the result.

### **Protective**

Protective Assets can be used to absorb the consequences of failure. A Protective Asset has a number of slots equal to its Quality rating. When the Actions or Reactions of the protagonist wielding the Asset would result in filling one or more slots of the specified type, the protagonist may instead fill up to that many slots for the Asset. The Asset specifies if and when these slots are cleared.

### **Restricted**

Restricted Assets have requirements to be used. For example, they may require certain Skill ranks or Affinities.

### **Bulky**

A Bulky Asset fills two slots for its type in a protagonist’s Inventory. For example, a Bicycle is a Bulky Vehicle Asset.

### **Stationary**

A Stationary Asset cannot be added to a protagonist’s Inventory and must be used at a specific location. For example, a Library is a Stationary Reference Asset.

### **Compact**

A Compact Asset does not contribute to a protagonist’s Inventory limit for Assets of that type. Running Shoes are Compact Vehicle Assets.

# Advancement

## **Minor Milestones**

A Minor Milestone occurs at the end of every session. The referee may apply it immediately or at the start of the next session.

At a Minor Milestone, each protagonist does the follow:

1. Refresh Affinity free invokes  
2. Attempt to heal one Wound by making a Recovery Test  
3. Spend Hope to clear Despair  
4. Protagonists may then reflect on their Traits  
5. Protagonists note their number of filled Corruption slots for the referee if they are above 5

### **Reflection**

At each Minor Milestone, protagonists may choose up to one of each of their Aspects, Agendas, and Connections. For each chosen Trait, that protagonist explains how that Trait was meaningfully expressed or challenged in the preceding session.

### **Memories**

Each Trait reflected upon gains a Memory that summarizes that Reflection. Aspects, Agendas, and Connections can have up to 3 Memories. Once a third Memory is added, clear the memories and advance the Trait. When a Trait Advances, the protagonist gains an Affinity representing their growth.

## **Major Milestones**

A Major Milestone occurs at the end of the last session in a story arc, as determined by the referee. A Major Milestone typically occurs every 3-5 sessions. At a Major Milestone, each protagonist benefits from a Minor Milestone and then:

1. Clears all filled Despair slots  
2. Refreshes their Hope  
3. Refreshes their Effort  
4. Gain a Class Feature of their choice (see Classes)  
5. Gain a Charm of their choice (see Charms)  
6. Increase Skill ranks by spending SP  
7. Gain Talents by spending XP  
8. Protagonists note their number of filled Corruption slots for the referee

### **Gaining Skill Ranks**

At each Major Milestone, protagonists may spend any amount of accrued SP to increase Skill ranks. To increase a Skill rank, you must spend 5 times the desired rank. SP must be paid for each rank sequentially.

For example, a protagonist that wishes to increase their Craft Skill rank from 3 to 5 must first spend 20 SP to increase their rank to 4\. They may then spend 25 SP to increase it to 5\. They would need to spend a total of 45\.

## **Talents**

Talents are special features that enhance protagonist capabilities in ways other than sheer numerical bonuses. There are a wide range of Talents with varying requirements and benefits.

### **Experience Points and Gaining Talents**

At each Minor Milestone, the referee awards each protagonist 1 Experience Point (XP) for each challenge the group has overcome since the last Minor Milestones. Protagonists that are part of the group but did not participate in the challenge are still awarded the XP.

At a Major Milestone, protagonists may spend XP to gain Talents. For every 10 XP spent, the protagonist gains a Talent of their choice for which they qualify.

### **Talent Slots**

All Talents must be placed into an unoccupied Talent slot. Protagonists unlock Talent slots by increasing their Skill ranks. Protagonists gain a new Talent slot at ranks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\.

### **Ability Rank Increase**

Talents increase protagonist Ability ranks. When a Talent is placed into a slot for a Skill, they increase their rank in the Ability associated with that Skill by 1 (to a maximum of 10).

### **Repeating Talents**

Most Talents may only be taken once. Some Talents specify that they may be taken multiple times and may offer multiple options that may be taken each time.

# Classes

Classes define a protagonist’s archetype and long-term thematic direction. A protagonist’s Class is chosen when they are created. When a protagonist gains their Class, they gain that Class’ Core Features.

At each Major Milestone, a protagonist may choose one new Class Feature that they qualify for from their Class.

# Magic

## **Transformation**

The ability to Transform into a magical state is defining for protagonists in Stars & Signs. Protagonists may Transform by taking 1d10 Corruption, no Action required.

While a protagonist is Transformed, they gain access to their Magical Talents, Relic, and Regalia.

A protagonist’s Transformation lasts until one or more of the following criteria are met:

* They choose to end it (no Action required)  
* They reach a Major Milestone  
* They become Broken, Consumed, or Defeated  
* They fill their last Energy Counter slot

## **Energy Counter**

When a protagonist Transforms, they gain access to their Energy Resource Counter. Each protagonist’s Energy Counter has 5 slots, each of which are worth 5 Energy. A protagonist’s Energy Counter is used to fuel their Magic.

A protagonist clears all the slots of their Energy Counter when their Transformation ends. They can also clear 5 Energy slots by taking 1d10 Corruption.

## **Upgrading Scale**

When a protagonist takes an Action while Transformed, they can spend 1d10 Energy to upgrade that Action’s Scale to 3\. To do so, the protagonist must describe how they use one of their Magical Affinities to meaningfully aid in that Action.

Physical Resist Tests that a protagonist makes while Transformed are made at Scale 3 due to their Regalia.

## **Magical Gifts**

Each protagonist has a unique Magical Gift, which describes what is unique about their powers.

### **Magical Affinities**

Each protagonist has one or more Magical Affinities. Magical Affinities can only be invoked while Transformed. While Transformed, protagonists have a great deal of freedom in how they use their Magical Affinities, being limited only by their creativity and Scale they’re able to achieve.

Protagonists gain Magical Affinities when they are created and then may increase their ranks in these Affinities by advancing their Aspects.

### **Signature Moves**

Each protagonist has a set of Signature Moves they can perform while Transformed. When a protagonist is created, they gain two Signature Moves, as described in the Protagonist Creation rules.

To create a Signature Move, a protagonist chooses an Action type and Skill combination and describes how they use their Magical Affinities to perform a specific course of action involving that combination. They then give this Signature Move a name.

Whenever a protagonist performs the described Action, they may clear their filled Energy slots and gain 1d10 Corruption to upgrade the Scale of that Action to 4\.

### **The Catch**

Each protagonist’s magic has a drawback, limitation, cost, or weakness called a Catch. Protagonists design their own Catch at creation. A Catch can be almost anything, but it should represent some sort of magical complication which requires 

A protagonist’s Catch may be compelled by either the referee or protagonist. When a Catch is compelled, the protagonist may choose one:

* Clear one Energy slot  
* Gain one Temporary Energy slot. Temporary Energy slots can be used like Energy slots but when they are filled, they disappear. A protagonist can have up to 5 Temporary Energy slots at a time. All Temporary Energy slots are cleared at each Minor Milestone.

When a referee compels a protagonist’s Catch, they may accept or refuse. If they refuse, they gain 1d10 Corruption.

## **Relic**

While Transformed, protagonists are equipped with a Relic. A Relic is a magical artifact unique to the protagonist that represents their personality and magic. They design their Relic during creation and use it to channel their magic.

Nothing can truly separate a protagonist from their Relic and if it is lost, it simply reappears in the protagonist’s hand when they desire it.

Relics have no specific functionality, but many Talents confer benefits to them.

## **Regalia**

Regalia is the magical clothing that protagonists don during their Transformation. During protagonist creation, each player chooses a benefit for their Regalia, which is conferred to all protagonists while Transformed.

## **Wishes**

A protagonist may, just once, use their magic to make a Wish. A Wish is capable of accomplishing goals even greater than what can be accomplished at Scale 5\. For example, a Wish may allow a protagonist to alter historical events, revive the dead, or even harm a Great One. The referee should work carefully with the protagonist to determine what exactly can be accomplished given the protagonist’s Gift before they make it. 

Once a protagonist makes a Wish, they are Defeated. The referee determines what happens to the protagonist \- they may become an abstract concept, lose their magic forever, or simply burn out their life fueling their overwhelming magic. Nothing may prevent or undo this fate once a Wish is made, not even another Wish.

## **Charms**

Charms are small magical trinkets that a protagonist can wear even outside their Transformation. Charms often act as Assets and may convey subtle magical powers that can be used unnoticed in the mundane world. Some Talents grant the ability to create Charms.

Optionally, the referee may grant protagonists materials which they can use to craft Charms without having a Talent.
