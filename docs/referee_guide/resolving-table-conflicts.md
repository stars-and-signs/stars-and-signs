# Resolving Conflicts Between Protagonists

Players determine the outcome of conflicts between protagonists. While the players may use a method of their choice, the referee may suggest a method that they believe is suitable given the conflict at hand.

If the protagonists are unable to come to an agreement in a timely fashion, the referee may choose one of the methods selected by the protagonists.

### Bidding Hope

Protagonists bid their unspent Hope. The winning protagonist distributes the bid Hope points evenly amongst the losing protagonists then chooses the outcome of the conflict.

### Escalating Consequences

Taking turns beginning with a random protagonist involved in the conflict, protagonists take turns raising the severity of the personal fallout they suffer due to the conflict. The referee serves as a judge regarding if the stakes have been raised. The process ends once no one is willing to raise, with the last bidder being the winner that chooses the outcome. All involved protagonists suffer the fallout they wagered.
