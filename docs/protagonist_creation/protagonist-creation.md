# Protagonist Creation

To create a protagonist, follow these steps in order.

## Identity & Motivation

Give your protagonist a name and describe their pronouns. These may be placeholders for now.

## Personality

### Aspects

Design a personality for your protagonist by creating a Heart, Mask, and Shadow Aspect.

If you need inspiration, draw three tarot cards at random, assigning one to your Heart, your Mask, and your Shadow. Use the meaning of these cards to generate your Aspects.

### Conviction & Tendency

Choose one Affinity from the Conviction list and one from the Tendency list.

## Class

Choose a [Class](../core_rules/classes). You gain the Core Features for that Class.

### Class Agenda

Create an [Agenda](../core_rules/protagonist-traits#agendas) using your Class’s suggested Agendas for inspiration.

## Background

### Background Skills

Choose three different[Skills](../core_rules/skills). Gain 2 ranks in each chosen Skill.

### School Affinities

Choose three [Affinities](../core_rules/protagonist-traits#affinities) from the Academic, Sports, and Artistic [Affinities lists](../affinity-lists) in any combination. You gain 2 ranks in each of the chosen Affinities.

### Extracurricular Affinities

Choose two Affinities from the Otaku, Outdoors, Social, and Practical Affinity lists in any combination. You gain 2 ranks in each of the chosen Affinities.

### Background Anchor

Create an [Anchor](../core_rules/protagonist-traits#anchors) based on your protagonist’s interests. Choose either a hobby or group related to that interest.

## Social Identity

### Style

Choose three adjectives from the following table to describe your protagonist's style. Choose a single row no more than twice. For each adjective, you gain two of the corresponding Mana.

| **Descriptors**                  | **Mana (+2)** |
| :------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Warm, vibrant, bold              | Fire          |
| Cool, fluid, soothing            | Water         |
| Light, open, shimmering          | Air           |
| Grounded, solid, rich            | Earth         |
| Ethereal, old-fashioned, quirky  | Spirit        |
| Bright, pure, uplifting          | Light         |
| Deep, mysterious, dramatic       | Dark          |
| Organic, cozy, wild              | Nature        |
| Modern, structured, professional | Metal         |

### Subculture

Choose an Affinity from the Cultures list. You gain 3 ranks in the chosen Affinity.

### Relationship Anchor

Create an Anchor based on a relationship you have with another character or group of characters. Determine the nature of this relationship by determining if your Light or Dark Mana is higher. If your Light is higher, the relationship is positive. Conversely, if your Dark is higher, the relationship is adversarial. If they are equal, the relationship is fraught and alternates between the two.

## Astrological Sign

Each protagonist has a sun, moon, and ascendent astrological sign. This can be chosen by considering the protagonist’s date of birth or by choosing them. For each of their signs, the protagonist gains \+1 ranks to two different [Abilities](../core_rules/abilities) and one Mana, as shown in the Sign Bonuses Table.
