# Counters

Counters are a structured method for tracking progress towards an evolving outcome, such as accumulating successes or threats advancing towards failure. Counters make complicated, multi-step situations more manageable.

## Points and Slots

Counters are comprised of one to ten “slots”. Each slot is worth 5 points by default, but may be assigned when the Counter is defined.

Whenever points are assigned to a Counter, fill slots until no points remain. Even if only a single point remains, the entire slot must be filled. For example, if you gain 7 points towards a Counter, fill two slots. Often, points towards a Counter will be determined by rolling one or more d10s.

When the last slot is filled, a Counter is completed. The repercussions of which depend on the Counter.

## Temporary Slots

Some features and effects can cause Counters to gain Temporary Counter slots. A Counter cannot have more than 10 slots total, including Temporary slots.

Temporary Counter slots are lost upon being filled.

## Counter Types

### Progress

Used when achieving a goal requires multiple successful contributions toward the same challenge. Examples:

* Eliminating a major foe through combat  
* Disabling a complex security system  
* Completing a magical ritual

### Danger

Used when a threat, hazard, or opposition is emerging or advancing toward a minor goal. The goal would meaningfully worsen the situation, but not outright preclude the protagonist’s objectives. Examples:

* Hostile creatures closing in on the protagonists’ location  
* Cultists summoning a powerful demon  
* Pursuing foes narrowing the gap in a chase

### Defeat

Used to measure the protagonists’ proximity to a major failure that isn’t tied to personal harm. When a Defeat Counter fills, something crucial is lost. Examples:

* Fire consuming a protagonist’s home
* A critical artifact being corrupted beyond repair
* Cultists summoning a world-ending cosmic horror

### Resource

Used to track finite resources that diminish with use. When a Resource Counter fills, whatever it corresponds to is depleted. Examples:

* Ammunition  
* Magical energy  
* Favors and reputation

Filling a Resource Counter is usually refered to as "spending" the resource that the Counter represents. For example, a protagonist has an Ammunition Resource Counter that has 5 slots worth 5 Ammunition each. They use their Gun Asset, which requires spending 1d10 Ammunition. They roll 7, meaning they need to fill 2 Ammunition slots to use the Asset.

### Timer

Similar to a Danger or Defeat Counter but measures the approach of a neutral event. Timer Counters typically advance whenever a protagonist takes an Action, regardless of success or failure. For example, measuring the amount of time left in a Flashback.

### Inventory

Used to track specific items, such as Memories or Assets. Unlike other Counter slots, which are either filled or unfilled, each Inventory slot holds a specific game object which should be tracked.

All Inventory Counter slots are worth one item.
