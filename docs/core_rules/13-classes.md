# Classes

Classes define a protagonist’s archetype and long-term thematic direction. A protagonist’s Class is chosen when they are created. When a protagonist gains their Class, they gain that Class’ Core Features.

At each Major Milestone, a protagonist may choose one new Class Feature that they qualify for from their Class.
