# Assets

Assets are tools, implements, relationships, or leverage that empowers protagonists to act more effectively. An Asset may be a physical object (a bat, a cellphone), social leverage (blackmail, membership in a club, a title of honor), or an independent ally. Regardless of form, Assets provide mechanical benefits through their Functions.

A protagonist may apply up to one of their Assets when they use it to perform one of its Functions. When a protagonist uses an Asset for an Action, they can choose one of the following benefits:

* **Upgrade Ability die.** The protagonist may upgrade the size of their Ability die for the check to match that of the Quality die for the Asset used.  
* **Asset bonus.** The protagonist adds the Asset’s Quality rating directly to the check’s result.

The protagonist must declare which benefit they’re choosing before making the roll.

## **Functions**

Each Asset has a set of Functions for which it is suitable to be used. Each Function essentially serves as an independent Asset, capable of having different Quality ratings, Scales, and other properties.

## **Quality**

The Functions of an Asset have Quality ratings ranging from 0 to 5\. The Quality of an Asset’s Function determines the bonus or size of the Quality die.

| Quality Rating | Quality Die | Quality Bonus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | d0 | 0 |
| 1 | d4 | 1 |
| 2 | d6 | 2 |
| 3 | d8 | 3 |
| 4 | d10 | 4 |
| 5 | d12 | 5 |

Most Assets have a Quality of 1 or better. When used for something other than one of its Functions, an Asset is treated as having a Quality of 0\.

## **Asset Scale**

Assets may upgrade one or more of the Scales of Actions and Reactions made using them. This upgraded Scale may allow a protagonist to overcome challenges outside of what they could normally achieve.

For example:

* A Baseball Bat upgrades the Potency of Violence Actions to 1.
* A Magical Sword, even while wielded by a normal human, upgrades the Potency of Violence Actions to 3.
* A Car upgrades the Speed of Traversal Actions made using it to 2.

## **Asset Types**

Asset types are descriptive tags used for classification, narrative clarity, and interactions with Talents, Perks, and other features.

Common types of Assets with examples include:

* **Weapons.** Blades, bats, and firearms. Weapons are used to harm things. All Weapon Assets can be used for Eliminate (Violence) or Hinder (Violence).  
* **Armor.** Bulletproof vests, riot shields, plate mail, and magical barriers. All Armor Assets can be used for Bolster (Defense).   
* **Leverage.** Blackmail, favors, and bribes. Leverage can be used for Influence Actions using one or more Skills.  
* **Vehicles.** Bikes, running shoes, cars, mechs, and trains. Vehicles are used for Traverse Actions.  
* **References.** Books, libraries, and informants. References are used for Discover Actions.  
* **Materials.** Raw components, damaged objects, and power tools. Materials are used for Create (Craft) Actions.  
* **Obstructions.** Barriers and hiding spots. Obstructions are used to Obscure (Stealth) or Bolster (Defense).  
* **Gadgets.** Technological devices such as cellphones, tablets, and computers. Gadgets are used to Discover, Influence, and Create.  
* **Tools.** A catch-all that describes Assets used for physical tasks such as lock-picks, grappling hooks, and battering rams.  
* **Allies.**  
* **Relics.**  
* **Regalia.**

## **Inventory**

For each Asset type, a protagonist can possess up to two Assets of that type at a time. Some protagonist features or Asset properties may affect this carry capacity. Protagonists can swap the Assets they’re carrying at narrative opportunities.

## **Asset Properties**

Some Assets possess additional mechanical traits. These properties can apply to either the Asset itself or specific Functions of that Asset.

### **Impactful**

An Impactful Function improves progress towards a specified task that requires a Progress Counter. When a protagonist rolls for Progress for that task, they add the Asset’s Quality to the result.

### **Protective**

Protective Assets can be used to absorb the consequences of failure. A Protective Asset has a number of slots equal to its Quality rating. When the Actions or Reactions of the protagonist wielding the Asset would result in filling one or more slots of the specified type, the protagonist may instead fill up to that many slots for the Asset. The Asset specifies if and when these slots are cleared.

### **Restricted**

Restricted Assets have requirements to be used. For example, they may require certain Skill ranks, Affinities, or Proficiencies.

### **Bulky**

A Bulky Asset fills two slots for its type in a protagonist’s Inventory. For example, a Bicycle is a Bulky Vehicle Asset.

### **Stationary**

A Stationary Asset cannot be added to a protagonist’s Inventory and must be used at a specific location. For example, a Library is a Stationary Reference Asset.

### **Compact**

A Compact Asset does not contribute to a protagonist’s Inventory limit for Assets of that type. Running Shoes are Compact Vehicle Assets.
