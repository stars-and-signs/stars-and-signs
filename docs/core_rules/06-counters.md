# Counters

Counters are a structured method for tracking progress towards an evolving outcome, such as accumulating successes or threats advancing towards failure. Counters make complicated, multi-step situations more manageable.

## **Points and Slots**

Counters are comprised of one to ten “slots”. Each slot is worth 5 points. Whenever points are assigned to a Counter, fill slots until no points remain. Even if only a single point remains, the entire slot must be filled. For example, if you gain 7 points towards a Counter, fill two slots.

When the last slot is filled, a Counter is completed. The repercussions of which depend on the Counter.

Often, points towards a Counter will be determined by rolling one or more d10s.

## **Counter Types**

### **Progress**

Used when achieving a goal requires multiple successful contributions toward the same challenge. Examples:

* Eliminating a major foe through combat  
* Disabling a complex security system  
* Completing a magical ritual

### **Danger**

Used when a threat, hazard, or opposition is emerging or advancing toward a minor goal. The goal would meaningfully worsen the situation, but not outright preclude the protagonist’s objectives. Examples:

* Hostile creatures closing in on the protagonists’ location  
* Cultists summoning a powerful demon  
* Pursuing foes narrowing the gap in a chase

### **Defeat**

Used to measure the protagonists’ proximity to a major failure that isn’t tied to personal harm. When a Defeat Counter fills, something crucial is lost. Examples:

* Fire consuming a protagonist’s home  
* An artifact being corrupted beyond repair  
* Cultists summoning a world-ending demon

### **Resource**

Used to track finite resources that diminish with use. When a Resource Counter fills, whatever it corresponds to is depleted. Examples:

* Ammunition  
* Magical energy  
* Favors and reputation

### **Timer**

Similar to a Danger or Defeat Counter but measures the approach of a neutral event. Timer Counters typically advance whenever a protagonist takes an Action, regardless of success or failure. For example, measuring the amount of time left in a Flashback.
