# Corruption

Corruption represents spiritual erosion, magical contamination, and a loss of free will that threatens protagonists wielding magic.

Each protagonist has a Corruption Counter with 10 slots, each slot is worth 5 Corruption. Protagonists gain Corruption by using magic or by refusing Aspect compels.

## Reducing Corruption

Protagonists can reduce their Corruption by compelling an Anchor. Whenever a protagonist compels an Anchor, instead of regaining Hope, they may clear one Corruption slot.

## Effects of Corruption

Gaining Corruption has no impact during a session. Instead, it only begins to impact protagonists after Milestones.

The referee gets a Temptation for each protagonist that reaches a Minor Milestone with at least 5 filled Corruption slots.

For each protagonist that reaches a Major Milestone with at least 1 filled Corruption slot, the referee gains a Corruption Fallout which they can use against that protagonist before the next Major Milestone. The severity of this Corruption Fallout depends on the level of Corruption. It may be Minor, Major, or Severe.

The Referee Guide has more information about the effects of Temptations.

## Consumed

A protagonist that gains Corruption while already having 10 filled Corruption slot becomes Consumed, at which point they choose one of the following options. Once they choose an option, they clear 5 filled Corruption slots and end the Consumed state.

### Burn Anchor

The protagonist permanently loses one of their Anchors. At the next narrative opportunity, or via a Flashback, the referee and player reveal how that tie was destroyed. If a protagonist would lose the final Anchor in this way, they cannot choose this option.

### Drain Memories

The protagonist chooses five Memories from among their Aspects, Connections, or Agendas. They lose each chosen Memory. The protagonist cannot choose this option if they do not have at least five Memories amongst their Traits.

### Dramatic Confrontation

The protagonist’s Corruption erupts violently. The remaining protagonists face opposition with a 10-slot Progress Counter.

If the group overcomes this opposition, the Consumed protagonist is saved and their Temptation points are lost.

If the remaining protagonists yield or are Defeated, the Consumed protagonist must choose the Fall to Darkness option instead.

### Fall to Darkness

The protagonist is lost. They are retired (as if Defeated) but they become a Signbearer under the referee’s control. They may create a new protagonist at the next Minor Milestone.
