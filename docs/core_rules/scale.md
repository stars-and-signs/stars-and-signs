# Scale

Scales are abstract measures of what a protagonist is capable of accomplishing given their narrative positioning, tools, and features. Scales apply to Actions, Reactions, and challenges. A Scale defines the order of magnitude of what is possible. It does not describe the mere relative difficulty of a given task.

## Scale Ratting

Scale ranges from 0 to 5. By default, all Actions and Reactions are Scale 0 unless a feature or Asset explicitly increases them or there is narrative justification for a higher Scale.

* The default Scale of a protagonist’s Actions and Reactions is Scale 0 \- everyday human capabilities.
* Scale 1 is what a normal person could accomplish with simple tools or Proficiency.
* Scale 2 requires advanced tools.
* Scale 3 is beyond normal human technology and capabilities. Only highly advanced equipment, such as an entire factory or military weapons, or magic can achieve Scale 3.
* Scale 4 is far beyond what a mundane human can accomplish. Even with magic, Scale 4 is difficult to achieve.
* Scale 5 is the apex of what can be accomplished by a protagonist. Scale 5 can be reached only with the aid of a Wish.

Examples of tasks at each Scale are provided later in the Skills Description section.

## Scale Factors

Scale is a composite of four underlying factors. The Scale of an Action or challenge may derive primarily from one of these factors or a combination of multiple. It is not important to assign an exact value to each of these, as they simply guide the referee to determining the overall Scale.

* **Potency.** How forceful, destructive, influential, or impactful the outcome is. Lifting a car has a higher Potency than lifting moving boxes.  
* **Speed.** How rapidly the outcome can be achieved. Chasing down a car has a higher Speed than chasing down a culprit on foot.  
* **Scope.** The breadth of the outcome in terms of area of effect or number of targets. Magically healing an entire group is higher Scope than doing so for an individual.
* **Range.** The distance at which you can interact. Shooting a target miles away is higher Range than someone in the same room.

## Required Scale

An Action or Reaction cannot overcome a challenge with a higher Scale. For example, an unarmed strike (Potency 0) cannot meaningfully harm an armored vehicle (Potency 3).

If a Scale gap makes an Action impossible, the referee should plainly state so instead of calling for a Check.

## Excess Scale

If a protagonist succeeds on an Action (the result of their check is at least 10\) and at least one of that Action’s Scales exceeds the corresponding Scale of the challenge, they gain an Extra. Excess Scale grants only one Extra per check, regardless of the size of the difference or number of Scales in excess.

## Upgrade Scale

Protagonists may gain Upgrades to Scale factors from their features. When a protagonist performs an Action with Upgraded Scale, treat that Scale factor as 1 higher for purposes of matching Scale.

Scale may only be Upgraded by a single source at a time.


## Reducing Scale

Some challenges may be outside what a protagonist can accomplish due to Scale. At the referee's discretion, one or more Scale factors for a challenge may be reduced by 1 by undertaking an Extended Challenge with a Scale one less than the primary challenge. The number of Progress slots for this Extended Challenge are determined by the referee.

For example, a protagonist that wishes to destroy a heavy vault door (Potency 2) but only has basic tools (Potency 1) may undertake an Extended Challenge with 5 Progress slots to reduce the Potency of the vault door to 1. They may then undertake another Extended Challenge to actually accomplish their primary goal of destroying the vault door.
