# Advancement

## Minor Milestones

A Minor Milestone occurs at the end of every session. The referee may apply it immediately or at the start of the next session.

At a Minor Milestone, each protagonist does the follow:

1. Refresh Affinity free invokes  
2. Attempt to heal one Wound by making a Recovery Test  
3. Spend Hope to clear Despair  
4. Protagonists may then reflect on their Traits  
5. Protagonists note their number of filled Corruption slots for the referee if they are above 5

### Reflection and Memories

At each Minor Milestone, protagonists may choose up to one of each of their Aspects, Agendas, and Connections. For each chosen Trait, that protagonist explains how that Trait was meaningfully expressed or challenged in the preceding session to Reflect on that Trait. For each Reflection, the protagonist gains a Memory that represents it and adds it to their Memory Counter. See Traits for more information.

## Major Milestones

A Major Milestone occurs at the end of the last session in a story arc, as determined by the referee. A Major Milestone typically occurs every 3-5 sessions. At a Major Milestone, each protagonist benefits from a Minor Milestone and then:

1. Clears all filled Despair slots  
2. Refreshes their Hope  
3. Refreshes their Effort  
4. Gain a rank in their Class and the Major Class Features corresponding to that rank
5. Increase Skill ranks by spending XP
6. Protagonists note their number of filled Corruption slots for the referee

### Gaining Skill Ranks

At each Major Milestone, protagonists may spend any amount of accrued XP to increase Skill ranks. To increase a Skill rank, you must spend an amount of XP equal to 5 times the desired rank. XP must be paid for each rank sequentially.

For example, a protagonist that wishes to increase their Craft Skill rank from 3 to 5 must first spend 20 XP to increase their rank to 4\. They may then spend 25 XP to increase it to 5\. They would need to spend a total of 45 XP\.
