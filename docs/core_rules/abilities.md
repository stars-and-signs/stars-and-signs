# Abilities

Every protagonist’s capabilities are defined by their nine Abilities. Each Ability captures a broad mode of capability.

Abilities are grouped into three categories \- Physical, Mental, and Emotional. These categories matter for certain features.

The nine Abilities are:

## List of Abilities and Skills

### Physical

* **Might.** Force, raw strength, and physical speed.  
* **Grace.** Balance, precision, reflexes, and finesse.  
* **Endurance.** Stamina, toughness, and health.

### Mental

* **Intellect.** Analysis, knowledge, problem-solving, and technical skills.  
* **Cunning.** Cleverness, improvisation, and trickery.  
* **Will.** Mental resilience, patience, focus, and studiousness.

### Emotional

* **Confidence.** Presence, likability, assertiveness, and bold projection.  
* **Guile.** Misdirection, emotional manipulation, and decorum.  
* **Empathy.** Sensitivity, compassion, and emotional insight.

## **Ability Ranks**

Each protagonist has a rank of 1 to 10 in each of the nine Abilities. Protagonists can increase their ranks in Abilities with Talents.

## **Ability Die**

An Ability’s rank determines the Ability die added to Checks that use that Ability:

| Ability Rank | Ability Die |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | d0 |
| 2-3 | d4 |
| 4-5 | d6 |
| 6-7 | d8 |
| 8-9 | d10 |
| 10 | d12 |

Like Circumstance dice, features can grant Boons and Banes to Ability die when making Checks that use that die.
