# Magic

## Energy Counter

Each protagonist has an Energy Resource Counter with 5 Energy slots, which they use to power their Magic.

At each Minor Milestone, each protagonist clears all of their filled Energy slots.

## Transformation

A protagonist may assume their magical identity by filling 1 Corruption slot. While Transformed, a protagonist dons their Regalia, replacing their other clothing; conjures their Relic; and is able to use their Magical Talents.

A Transformed protagonist remains in this state until one of the following conditions:

* They become Consumed, Broken, or are Defeated.
* They suffer the Dispel Fallout.
* They reach a Minor Milestone.
* They choose to end their Transformation (no Action required).

When the Transformation ends, a protagonist's Relic vanishes, their Regalia reverts to their normal clothing, and loses access to their Magical Talents.

## Magical Affinities

Each protagonist has one or more Affinities from the Magical Affinity list. Magical Affinities can only be invoked while Transformed.

While Transformed, a protagonist may freely manipulate the subjects of their Magical Affinities, so long as they're able to achieve the appropriate Scale for the described Action. For example, a protagonist with Affinity for Fire Magic may conjure flames to attack an enemy, even when none is present.

A protagonist does not need to invoke a Magical Affinity in order to manipulate it.

Protagonists gain Magical Affinities when they are created and then may increase their ranks in these Affinities when they Advance their Traits.

## Magical Actions

When a protagonist takes an Action while Transformed, if they are utilizing one of their Magical Affinities in some way, they may spend 1 Energy to upgrade the Potency of that Action to 3.

## Magical Gifts

Each protagonist has a unique Magical Gift, which describes how they regain Energy. During protagonist creation, choose one of the following Gifts.

### Overdrive

You gain your magic in one large burst but once you're out, you'll need to wait to cool down.

Increase the number of slots in your Energy Counter by 5.

### Emotional Battery

Your magic derives from your flowing emotions.

While Transformed, you can enter a Mood of your choice (no Action required). When you do, you gain a number of Temporary Energy slots equal to half your ranks in the Ability associated with that Mood.

### Binding Vow

Your convictions power your magic.

Choose one of your Conviction Affinities or Heart Aspect. When you compel the chosen Trait, you gain 5 Temporary Energy slots in addition to the other benefits.

If you refuse a compel for the chosen Trait, fill all of your unfilled Energy slots. You cannot gain Temporary Energy slots or clear filled Energy slots until the next Minor Milestone.

### Wind-Up

You need to prepare to get full use of your magic via a ritual or time to charge up.

Choose a Skill in which you have at least a +1 modifier. You can use the Create Action with that Skill to charge your power:

* **Critical Hit.** Gain 5 Temporary Energy slots and an Extra - clear your filled Temporary Energy slots.
* **Hit.** Gain 5 Temporary Energy slots.
* **Graze.** Mitigation Cost - gain 1 Temporary Energy slot.
* **Miss.** Harm Fallout - gain 1 Corruption.

### Dark Seed

You can gain enormous amounts of magical power in exchange for darkening your spirit.

While Transformed, you can suffer 1d10 Corruption to gain 5 Temporary Energy (no Action required). The number of d10s rolled to determine the amount of Corruption suffered increases by 1 each time you use this feature before a Minor Milestone.

### Catch

Your magic has a weakness, drawback, or limitation that applies under specific circumstances.

Describe a situation where your magic is limited and choose a Cost. Whenever you use your magic in that scenario, you suffer the chosen Cost and gain 1 Temporary Energy.

Each protagonist’s magic has a drawback, limitation, cost, or weakness called a Catch. Protagonists design their own Catch at creation. A Catch can be almost anything, but it should represent some sort of complicatting factor.

## Relic

While Transformed, protagonists are equipped with a Relic. A Relic is a magical artifact unique to the protagonist that represents their personality and magic. They design their Relic during creation and use it to channel their magic.

Nothing can truly separate a protagonist from their Relic and if it is lost, it simply reappears in the protagonist’s hand when they desire it.

Relics have no specific functionality, but many Talents confer benefits to them.

## Regalia

Regalia is the magical clothing that protagonists don during their Transformation. While Transformed, a protagonist's Regalia grants them immense protection from physical harm. A Transformed protagonist has Potency 3 for Physical Resist Reactions.

## Wishes

Once per Major Milestone, when a protagonist uses their magic, they may make a Wish to attempt to achieve something monumental. The protagonist must describe the desired outcome of this Wish in 7 words or less.

When a protagonist makes a Wish, their Action gains +1 to one Scale of their choice. This can increase that Scale to a maximum of 5. Once the protagonist completes the Check, they immediately suffer the consequences of filling their 10th Corruption slot.

The effects of a Scale 5 Action may be grand, for example, a protagonist may:

* Instantly defeat a Signbearer.
* Harm the avatar of a Great One.
* Harm a weakened Sorcerer.
* Change a historical event.
* Revive someone who has recently died.
* Heal all of someone's Wounds.

Despite this, a Wish has limitations. It cannot undo the effects of another Wish, nor can it heal the repercussions of one. It also cannot undo the repercussions of filling 10 Corruption slots.

## Charms

Charms are small magical trinkets that a protagonist can wear even outside their Transformation. Charms often act as Assets and may convey subtle magical powers that can be used unnoticed in the mundane world. Some Talents grant the ability to create Charms.

Optionally, the referee may grant protagonists materials which they can use to craft Charms without having a Talent.
