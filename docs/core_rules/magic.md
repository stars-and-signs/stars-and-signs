# Magic

## Energy Counter

Each protagonist has an Energy Resource Counter with 5 Energy slots, which they use to power their Magic. A protagonist clears all of their filled Energy slots when they Transform and at each Minor Milestone.

The referee may use the Drain Complication targeting Transformed protagonists, which fills 1 to 10 Energy slots.

## Transformation

A protagonist may assume their magical identity by filling 1 Corruption slot. While Transformed, a protagonist dons their Regalia, replacing their other clothing; conjures their Relic; and is able to use their Magical Talents.

A Transformed protagonist remains in this state until one of the following conditions:

* They become Consumed, Broken, or are Defeated.
* They reach a Minor Milestone.
* They fill their final Energy slot without clearing it.
* They choose to end their Transformation (no Action required).

When the Transformation ends, a protagonist's Relic vanishes, their Regalia reverts to their normal clothing, and they lose access to their Magical Talents.

While Transformed, a protagonist can fill 1 Corruption slot to clear their filled Corruption slots (no Action required).

## Magical Affinities

Each protagonist has one or more Affinities from the Magical Affinity list. Magical Affinities can only be invoked while Transformed.

While Transformed, a protagonist may freely manipulate the subjects of their Magical Affinities, so long as they're able to achieve the appropriate Scale for the described Action. For example, a protagonist with Affinity for Fire Magic may conjure flames to attack an enemy, even when none is present.

A protagonist does not need to invoke a Magical Affinity in order to manipulate it.

Protagonists gain Magical Affinities when they are created and then may increase their ranks in these Affinities when they Advance their Traits.

## Relic

While Transformed, protagonists are equipped with a Relic. A Relic is a magical artifact unique to the protagonist that represents their personality and magic. They design their Relic during creation and use it to channel their magic.

Nothing can truly separate a protagonist from their Relic and if it is lost, it simply reappears in the protagonist’s hand when they desire it.

Unless a feature grants it one, Relics do not have Functions. Instead, a protagonist can use their Relic for any Action by spending 1 Energy and describing how the protagonist uses their Magical Affinities to do so. Actions using a Relic have a base Potency of 3 (regardless if it has a Function for that Action).

## Regalia

Regalia is the magical clothing that protagonists don during their Transformation. While Transformed, a protagonist's Regalia grants them immense protection from physical harm.

Regalia is an Armor Asset with a Resist (Defense) Function with a Quality of 0 and a Potency of 3.

## Magical Gifts

Each protagonist has a Magical Gift. Magical Gifts confer benefits under conditions unique to that Gift.

During protagonist creation, choose one of the following Gifts.

### Reliable Gift

You lack the extreme spikes in power of other Gifts but make up for it in terms of consistent power. Increase your number of Energy Counter slots by 5.

In addition, when you suffer the Corrupt Fallout, you may roll a d10. On a 6 or higher, reduce the amount of Corruption suffered to 0.

### Explosive Gift

You can increase your power reliably in small bursts but once you've expended that reserve, you must wait to do so again. Twice per Minor Milestone, when you perform an Action with your Relic, you can increase your Potency to 4.

### Escalating Gift

You can build up to explosive discharges of power. You gain a Momentum Counter with five slots. Whenever you score a Graze or better for an Action that uses your Relic, fill a Momentum slot. When your Momentum Counter is full, you can clear all filled slots to increase the Potency of an Action using your Relic to 4.

### Tainted Gift

You can increase your power at will, only limited by the amount of darkness you can endure. When you use your Relic for an Action, you may suffer 1d10 Corruption to increase the Potency to 4.

## Energy Sources

In addition to spending Corruption, protagonists may regain Energy through a variety of means, called Sources. When the campaign begins, the referee chooses one or more of these Sources to be available to all of the protagonists.

### Friendship

Protagonists can harness the power of friendship. When they compel a Connection or an Affinity that represents another character, instead of the usual benefits, they may clear up to 5 filled Energy slots. Excess cleared slots may be converted into Temporary Energy slots.

### Emotions

Protagonists gain power from their Emotions. While Transformed, a protagonist may enter a Mood to clear a number of filled Energy slots up to half their ranks in the Ability associatted with that Mood. Excess cleared slots may be converted into Temporary Energy slots.

### Beliefs

Protagonists power their magic through their strong beliefs. When they invoke an Aspect or an Affinity from the Conviction list, instead of the usual benefits, they may clear up to 5 filled Energy slots. Excess cleared slots may be converted into Temporary Energy slots.

### Essence

Protagonists may trade their health for power. A protagonist may choose to suffer a Mental or Physical Wound to clear up to 5 filled Energy slots. Excess cleared slots may be converted into Temporary Energy slots. To determine the Potency of the Wound, roll a d10, on a result of 6 or higher, the Potency is 2, otherwise the Potency is 1.

### Contracts

Protagonists may enter contracts with supernatural entities to gain Energy. The referee creates these entities as characters and determines the price. Roughly, the amount of Energy generated corresponds to the magnitude of the price:

* Small price - 1 Energy
* Medium price - 5 Energy
* Large price - 10 Energy

## Wishes

Once per Major Milestone, when a protagonist uses their Relic for an Action, they may make a Wish to attempt to achieve something monumental. The protagonist must describe the desired outcome of this Wish in 7 words or less.

When a protagonist makes a Wish, their Action gains +1 Potency. This can increase Potency to a maximum of 5. Once the protagonist completes the Check, they immediately suffer the consequences of filling their 10th Corruption slot.

The effects of a Scale 5 Action may be grand, for example, a protagonist may:

* Instantly defeat a Signbearer.
* Harm the avatar of a Great One.
* Harm a weakened Sorcerer.
* Change a historical event.
* Revive someone who has recently died.
* Heal all of someone's Wounds.

Despite this, a Wish has limitations. It cannot undo the effects of another Wish, nor can it heal the repercussions of one. It also cannot undo the repercussions of filling 10 Corruption slots.

## Charms

Charms are small magical trinkets that a protagonist can wear even outside their Transformation. Charms often act as Assets and may convey subtle magical powers that can be used unnoticed in the mundane world. Some Talents grant the ability to create Charms.

Optionally, the referee may grant protagonists materials which they can use to craft Charms without having a Talent.
