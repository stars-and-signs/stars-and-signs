# Magic

## **Transformation**

The ability to Transform into a magical state is defining for protagonists in Stars & Signs. Protagonists may Transform by filling 1 Corruption slot, no Action required.

While a protagonist is Transformed, they gain access to their Magical Talents, Relic, and Regalia.

A protagonist’s Transformation lasts until one or more of the following criteria are met:

* They choose to end it (no Action required)  
* They reach a Major Milestone  
* They become Broken, Consumed, or Defeated  
* They fill their last Energy Counter slot

## **Energy Counter**

When a protagonist Transforms, they gain access to their Energy Resource Counter. Each protagonist’s Energy Counter has 5 slots, each of which are worth 5 Energy. A protagonist’s Energy Counter is used to fuel their Magic.

A protagonist clears all the slots of their Energy Counter when their Transformation ends. They can also clear 5 Energy slots by filling 1 Corruption slot.

## **Upgrading Scale**

When a protagonist takes an Action while Transformed, they can spend 1 Energy slot to upgrade that Action’s Scale to 3\. To do so, the protagonist must describe how they use one of their Magical Affinities to meaningfully aid in that Action.

Physical Resist Tests that a protagonist makes while Transformed are made at Scale 3 due to their Regalia.

## **Magical Gifts**

Each protagonist has a unique Magical Gift, which describes what is unique about their powers.

### **Magical Affinities**

Each protagonist has one or more Magical Affinities. Magical Affinities can only be invoked while Transformed. While Transformed, protagonists have a great deal of freedom in how they use their Magical Affinities, being limited only by their creativity and Scale they’re able to achieve.

Protagonists gain Magical Affinities when they are created and then may increase their ranks in these Affinities by advancing their Aspects.

### **The Catch**

Each protagonist’s magic has a drawback, limitation, cost, or weakness called a Catch. Protagonists design their own Catch at creation. A Catch can be almost anything, but it should represent some sort of complicatting factor.

A protagonist’s Catch may be compelled by either the protagonist or referee. When a Catch is compelled, the protagonist may choose one:

* Clear one Energy slot  
* Gain one Temporary Energy slot.

When a referee compels a protagonist’s Catch, they may accept or refuse. If they refuse, they gain 1d10 Corruption.

A protagonist may choose to create a more severe Catch. In which case, they may increase the number of Energy slots regained or Temporary Energy slots gained by 1 or even 2, depending on the severity. The referee has final say over the severity level of a Catch.

## **Relic**

While Transformed, protagonists are equipped with a Relic. A Relic is a magical artifact unique to the protagonist that represents their personality and magic. They design their Relic during creation and use it to channel their magic.

Nothing can truly separate a protagonist from their Relic and if it is lost, it simply reappears in the protagonist’s hand when they desire it.

Relics have no specific functionality, but many Talents confer benefits to them.

## **Regalia**

Regalia is the magical clothing that protagonists don during their Transformation. During protagonist creation, each player chooses a benefit for their Regalia, which is conferred to all protagonists while Transformed.

## **Wishes**

A protagonist may, just once, use their magic to make a Wish. A Wish is capable of accomplishing goals even greater than what can be accomplished at Scale 5\. For example, a Wish may allow a protagonist to alter historical events, revive the dead, or even harm a Great One. The referee should work carefully with the protagonist to determine what exactly can be accomplished given the protagonist’s Gift before they make it. 

Once a protagonist makes a Wish, they are Defeated. The referee determines what happens to the protagonist \- they may become an abstract concept, lose their magic forever, or simply burn out their life fueling their overwhelming magic. Nothing may prevent or undo this fate once a Wish is made, not even another Wish.

## **Charms**

Charms are small magical trinkets that a protagonist can wear even outside their Transformation. Charms often act as Assets and may convey subtle magical powers that can be used unnoticed in the mundane world. Some Talents grant the ability to create Charms.

Optionally, the referee may grant protagonists materials which they can use to craft Charms without having a Talent.
