# Reactions & Tests

A Reaction occurs when a protagonist’s capabilities are being measured without them performing an Action. In other words, a Reaction is invoked when the world exerts pressure on the protagonist and they must endure, notice, recall, or maintain something rather than proactively attempting to change the situation. Reactions are resolved using Tests.

## **Reaction Types**

A Reaction belongs to one of the following types.

### **Resist**

When a protagonist is resisting some influence under the referee’s control. This includes physical danger or mental and social coercion.

Examples: A cultist strikes you with a club, a demon attempts to dominate your will, a bully tries to intimidate you, toxic miasma chokes you.

### **Notice**

When a protagonist’s senses or intuition are being tested.

Examples: Spotting a hidden figure watching from the rafters, sensing a shift in someone’s mood, or realizing a story doesn’t add up.

### **Remember**

When a protagonist attempts to recall information.

Examples: Recognizing a symbol of an obscure sect, remembering the weakness of a monster chasing you, or recalling a legend relevant to the situation.

### **Sustain**

When a protagonist is maintaining something, such as an effect or an extended effort.

Examples: keep a summoned entity under control, hold concentration under duress, maintain a grapple.

### **Support**

When a protagonist is participating in a Cooperation Check as a Follower.

Examples: stealthing as a group, working together to lift a heavy object, performing a group ritual.

### **Recover**

When a protagonist is attempting to recover from a Wounds.

## **Tests**

A Test is used to determine if a protagonist’s Reaction succeeds or fails. Unlike Checks, where players roll dice, Tests are resolved using a Difficulty roll made by the referee.

### **Difficulty Rolls**

To perform a Test, the referee rolls Difficulty dice, which is 2d10. The result is then compared against the protagonist’s most relevant Skill’s Reaction score, determined by the nature of the Reaction. If the Difficulty roll is equal to or greater than the Reaction score, the protagonist fails. Otherwise, the protagonist succeeds.

Tests are binary \- there are no partial successes, Costs, or Criticals for Tests.

### **Reaction Scores**

A protagonist’s Reaction Score for a Test depends on their ranks in the most relevant Skill and their ranks in the corresponding Ability. It is calculated using the following formula (rounding up the final result):

10 + (Ability rank \+ Skill rank)/2

### **Open or Secret Tests**

The referee may choose to roll Difficulty in secret when the protagonist should not immediately know whether they succeeded or failed, or even if a Test occurred at all.

# Cooperation

When two or more protagonists attempt something together and the entire group will either succeed or fail as a unit, they perform a Cooperation Check. A Cooperation Check has three steps:

1. Choose a Leader  
2. Followers choose their method of supporting and make a Test  
3. The Leader makes a Check to determine the group’s success, with modifiers from the Follower’s outcomes

## **Leader**

The group designates one protagonist as the Leader, which identifies whose Check will determine the group’s collective outcome.

The Leader is responsible for:

* Describing the group’s shared intent as a single Action  
* Determining the method they personally use  
* Making the final Check  
* Choosing Cost types and distributing the effects of Fallout, if appropriate

## **Followers**

All other participants in a Cooperation Check become Followers. Each Follower describes how they’re helping the group’s efforts.

Once  their method is chosen, each Follower makes a Support Test. Each Follower that succeeds grants \+2 to the Leader’s Check. Each Follower that fails grants \-2 to the Leader’s Check.

## **Collective Check**

After the Followers have made their Tests and the cumulative Cooperation modifier is calculated, the Leader makes a Check, as normal, adding the Cooperation modifier to the result.

## **Shared Fallout**

Cooperation spreads both benefits and risks. If the Leader’s Check results in:

* Each member of the group pays any Costs or suffers any Fallout.  
* The referee uses one Complication for the whole group.
