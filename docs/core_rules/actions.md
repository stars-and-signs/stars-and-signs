# Actions

In Stars & Signs, every attempt to change the situation or act on opposition is an Action. Actions are defined by the intent behind them, not the methods used. Two protagonists might take different approaches \- violence, intimidation, or magical control \- but if their goals are the same, they’re taking the same Action type.

## **Declaring an Action**

When a player describes what their protagonist is aiming to accomplish, the referee identifies the Action type that best fits the intended outcome. If the referee’s interpretation doesn’t match the player’s intent, the two refine the description until they both agree on the Action’s purpose.

Intent determines Action type. The method of Execution determines the Ability and Skill.

## **Action Types**

Each of the nine Action types is intentionally broad. They exist to classify outcomes, not to describe actions or narrative.

### **Eliminate**

To remove an obstacle, neutralize a threat, destroy an object, or otherwise take something out of play. While this may appear to be the most direct route to overall success, opposition often needs to be weakened or edges need to be gained to be able to tackle difficult goals.

**Examples:** knock out a guard, disable an explosive device, smash a reinforced lock.

### **Hinder**

To weaken the opposition's ability to act or resist.

**Examples:** grapple a cultist, throw sand in someone’s face, psychologically unbalance a suspect.

### **Bolster**

To improve someone’s position, well-being, or readiness.

**Examples:** shielding a civilian, giving a rousing pep-talk, healing Wounds or Stress.

### **Influence**

To change beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors through force of personality, well-argued facts, or social pressure.

**Examples:** debating philosophy, intimidating a bully into believing you’re a threat, flattering a rival into cooperation.

### **Obscure**

To hide something \- facts, objects, intentions, or yourself.

**Examples:** lying convincingly, staying out of sight, concealing contraband on your person.

### **Create**

To construct, assemble, fashion, or generate something new and lasting.

**Examples:** forging a tool, designing a new magical ritual, building a friendship.

### **Utilize**

To make use of a resource, tool, connection, or edge already available.

**Examples:** accessing secured databases, calling in a favor, channeling energy from an artifact.

### **Discover**

To gather information not currently known.

**Examples:** researching an enemy, reading a room, tracking a missing person, analyzing mystical residue.

### **Transport**

To move a person, including yourself, or object through space under adverse conditions.

**Examples:** pulling an ally from danger, navigating a narrow cliffside, chasing down a suspect.

## **Action Type Triggers**

Features (Talents, Class Features, Charms, Assets, and others) often specify that they apply when a particular Action type is taken with a specific Skill. These appear as Action type (Skill). The Skill used determines the Ability that contributes the Ability die to the Action. For example:

* Eliminate (Violence) means using Might and Violence to Eliminate  
* Influence (Charisma) means using Confidence and Charisma to Influence  
* Transport (Agility) means using Grace and Agility to Transport

## **Determining the Ability and Skill Used**

After the Action type is established, the fictional method the protagonist is using determines which Ability and Skill apply. For example, two protagonists that want to Hinder a yokai:

* One protagonist throws a heavy object at its legs to trip it, they make a Might (Strength) check.  
* The other taunts it to break its concentration, they make a Guile (Manipulation) check.

Both are Hinder Actions, but they use different Abilities and Skills based on the methods used.

## **Adjudicating Edge Cases**

Some situations fall between Action types. The referee should consider:

* Player intent  
* Consequences of success  
* Consequences of failure

Whichever Action type most accurately reflects the outcome is correct. When an Action would meaningfully accomplish more than one outcome, the referee may require separation Actions, or classify it by the dominant effect.

For example, setting off fireworks to distract guards while creating cover for allies:

* If the goal is to let allies pass unseen, the Action is Obscure.  
* If the goal is to unnerve and surprise the guard, the Action is Hinder.  
* If the fireworks serve as both, the referee may request multiple Actions for each objective.
