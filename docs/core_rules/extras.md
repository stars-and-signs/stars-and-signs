# Extras

Protagonists may gain one or more Extras for a successful Action from features or Critical Hits. Extras represent “above and beyond” outcomes \- additional impact, expanded effect, or secondary benefits that flow naturally from superior force, speed, range, or scope.

Extras are flexible in what they represent, but they can be thought of in terms of increasing one of the Scale factors:

* The protagonist rolls an additional d10 when determining the amount of points they earn towards a Counter (Potency).
* The protagonist creates a Trait in addition to accomplishing their goal (Potency).
* Additional targets are affected (Scope).
* The task is accomplished faster than expected (Speed).
* The referee skips using a Complication (Speed).
* The effects of success are longer lasting or permanent instead of temporary (Potency).
* A resulting Trait has an additional free invoke (Potency).

The referee determines the exact nature of an Extra, but some features may give players effects they may choose to convert their Extras into.
