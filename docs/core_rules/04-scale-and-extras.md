# Scale

Scales are abstract measures of what a protagonist is capable of accomplishing given their narrative positioning, tools, and features. Scales apply to Actions, Reactions, and challenges. A Scale defines the order of magnitude of what is possible. It does not describe the mere relative difficulty of a given task.

## **Scale Ratting**

Scale ranges from 0 to 5. By default, all Actions and Reactions are Scale 0 unless a feature or Asset explicitly increases them or there is narrative justification for a higher Scale.

* The default Scale of a protagonist’s Actions and Reactions is Scale 0 \- everyday human capabilities.
* Scale 1 is what a normal person could accomplish with simple tools.
* Scale 2 requires advanced tools.
* Scale 3 is beyond normal human technology and capabilities. Only highly advanced equipment, such as an entire factory or military weapons, or magic can achieve Scale 3.  
* Scale 4 is far beyond what a mundane human can accomplish and, even with highly specialized equipment. Even with magic, a protagonist must exert themselves to reach Scale 4.  
* Scale 5 is the apex of what can be accomplished by a protagonist. Scale 5 can be reached only with a combination of powerful magic and specialization or difficult rituals.

Examples of tasks at each Scale are provided later in the Skills Description section.

## **Scale Factors**

Scale is a composite of four underlying factors. The Scale of an Action or challenge may derive primarily from one of these factors or a combination of multiple. It is not important to assign an exact value to each of these, as they simply guide the referee to determining the overall Scale.

* **Potency.** How forceful, destructive, influential, or impactful the outcome is. Lifting a car has a higher Potency than lifting moving boxes.  
* **Speed.** How rapidly the outcome can be achieved. Chasing down a car has a higher Speed than chasing down a culprit on foot.  
* **Scope.** The breadth of the outcome in terms of area of effect or number of targets. Magically healing an entire group is higher Scope than doing so for an individual.
* **Range.** The distance at which you can interact. Shooting a target miles away is higher Range than someone in the same room.

## **Required Scale**

An Action or Reaction cannot overcome a challenge with a higher Scale. For example, an unarmed strike (Potency 0) cannot meaningfully harm an armored vehicle (Potency 3).

If a Scale gap makes an Action impossible, the referee should plainly state so instead of calling for a Check.

## **Proficiency**

When a protagonist performs an Action with which they have Proficient, treat their Potency Scale as 1 higher than it would otherwise be for that Action.

If multiple effects would grant Proficiency with the same Action, Proficiency applies only once.

## **Excess Scale**

If a protagonist succeeds on an Action (the result of their check is at least 10\) and at least one of that Action’s Scales exceeds the corresponding Scale of the challenge, they gain an Extra. Excess Scale grants only one Extra per check, regardless of the size of the difference or number of Scales in excess.

# Extras

Protagonists may gain one or more Extras for a successful Action from features or Critical Hits. Extras represent “above and beyond” outcomes \- additional impact, expanded effect, or secondary benefits that flow naturally from superior force, speed, range, or scope.

Extras are flexible in what they represent, but they can be thought of in terms of increasing one of the Scale factors:

* The protagonist rolls an additional d10 when determining the amount of points they earn towards a Counter (Potency).
* The protagonist creates a Trait in addition to accomplishing their goal (Potency).
* Additional targets are affected (Scope).
* The task is accomplished faster than expected (Speed).
* The referee skips using a Complication (Speed).
* The effects of success are longer lasting or permanent instead of temporary (Potency).
* A resulting Trait has an additional free invoke (Potency).

The referee determines the exact nature of an Extra, but some features may give players effects they may choose to convert their Extras into.
