# Basic Principles

* **Round up.** When a calculation results in a non-integer number, unless otherwise specified, round up to the higher nearest integer.  

# Dice, Boons, and Banes

This game relies on the use of a set of polyhedral dice that includes a: d0, d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12. Multiple die of the same size are often added together into a “dice pool”. When a dice pool is rolled, add all the dice together to get the result.

## **The Null Die (d0)**

The “d0” or “null die” is not a physical die that is rolled, like others. Instead, whenever you “roll” a d0, it results in a 0 unless it has one or more Boons or Banes. If a null die has one or more Boons, it produces 1\. Conversely, if it has one or more Banes, it results in \-1.

## **Boons**

A Boon represents some improvement to the result of a roll. Boons always apply to a specific die or dice pool. Boons are abbreviated “+1B” before specifying the die or dice pool they affect (e.g., “+1B Circumstance” or “+1B Ability”).

A die or dice pool can benefit from multiple Boons simultaneously (e.g. “+3B Circumstance”). A die or dice pool can benefit from up to five Boons at a time. Excess Boons are ignored.

When applying a Boon, add one additional die of the same type for each Boon applied. For example, when rolling 2d10 with \+2B becomes 4d10. The lowest dice are then dropped until only the original number of dice remain. The remaining dice are then totaled.

## **Banes**

Banes are the negative counterpart to Boons. It represents hindrances that worsen your odds of success. Banes are abbreviated as “-1B”. Like Boons, multiple Banes can be applied to the same die or dice. Only up to five Banes can apply to a single die or dice simultaneously.

When applying a Bane, add an extra die of the same type for each Bane applied. Roll the dice and drop the highest dice until only the original number of dice remain. Add the remaining dice together to get the total.

## **Boons and Banes Cancel**

If both Boons and Banes apply to the same die or dice pool, first subtract the number of Banes from the number of Boons and apply only the net amount. For example:

* \+3B Circumstance and \-1B Circumstance results in \+2B Circumstance, or roll 4d10 and take the highest two dice.  
* \+2B Circumstance and \-5B Circumstance results in \-3B Circumstance, or roll 5d10 and take the lowest two dice.  
* \+4B Circumstance and \-4B Circumstance results in \+0B Circumstance, or roll 2d10 and take the result.
