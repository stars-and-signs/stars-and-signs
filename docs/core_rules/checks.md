# Checks

A Check is the fundamental resolution mechanic of Stars & Signs. Whenever a protagonist attempts something that could reasonably fail, they make a Check. Checks combine Circumstance dice, an Ability die, and any additional dice from Advantages or other features to produce a single numerical result. The result then determines failure or the degree of success.

## **When to Call for a Check**

The referee calls for a Check only when both of the following conditions apply:

1. There’s uncertainty. Success or failure is not guaranteed by common sense or narrative positioning.  
2. There’s repercussions. Failure matters and meaningfully alters the situation.

If the Action is trivial, rote, or unopposed, don’t roll. Conversely, if success is impossible, even under perfect execution, don’t roll.

## **Parts of a Check**

To construct the dice pool for a check:

1. Start with the Circumstance dice, which is 2d10  
2. Then add the most applicable Ability die and the protagonist’s modifier in the corresponding Skill, if any.  
3. Then add any additional dice or modifiers from Advantages and other features.  
4. Apply Boons and Banes to the corresponding dice then roll the pool. Apply the rules for Boons and Banes by dropping dice, as appropriate.  
5. Sum the remaining dice to get the result. The total is the Check’s result.

## **Interpreting the Result**

To determine if an Action is a failure or the degree of success, compare the Check’s total to the following fixed resolution bands.

### **Miss (\< 10\)**

The protagonist’s attempt fails. They do not achieve their goal cleanly and the referee applies Fallout. Fallout may:

* Block the goal outright, or  
* Allow partial success with a significant drawback

In addition to Fallout, the referee introduces a Complication.

### **Graze (10-14)**

The protagonist achieves their intent, but must pay a Cost to do so. There are three types of Costs: Personal, Impact, or Opportunity. The protagonist chooses the type of Cost they pay, but the referee determines its exact nature. Costs should never fully negate the benefits of a protagonist’s success.

The Cost types are:

* **Personal Costs.** The acting protagonist suffers Stress, loses access to an Asset, or one of their NPC relationships is damaged.
* **Impact Costs.** The effects of the success are mitigated or delayed. If the Action would result in an Extra, it may be lost to fulfill this cost.
* **Opportunity Costs.** The protagonist is put into a worse position, they potentially get a Temporary Negative Trait,  lose a Temporary Positive Trait, or increase the Stakes of the Action.

In addition to the Cost, the referee introduces a Complication.

### **Hit (15-19)**

The protagonist scores an unambiguous success. They accomplish what they set out to do without cost, but the referee still has an opportunity to introduce a Complication.

### **Critical Hit (20+)**

A superior success. The protagonist not only accomplishes their goal, their Action gains \+1 Scale. Scale improves the magnitude, reach, or durability of the result, depending on the context.

Unless the Critical Hit results in an Extra that skips it, the referee then introduces a Complication.
