# Protagonist Traits

Protagonist Traits define who they are as a character beyond their Abilities and Skills. They shape their identity, relationships, motivations, and even how they remain grounded. Traits regularly evolve throughout play alongside the protagonist’s personal journey.

Protagonist Traits come in several forms:

* **Aspects.** Identity-defining attributes.  
* **Connections.** Bonds between protagonists.  
* **Agendas.** Motivations and personal goals.  
* **Anchors.** What grounds the protagonist.  
* **Affinities.** Finer specializations.

## Memories and Advancing

At Minor Milestones, protagonists gain Memories by Reflecting on their Aspects, Connections, and Agendas. Protagonists have a 5 slot Inventory Counter for Memories. When a protagonist gains a Memory, they note the Trait associated with that Memory.

When a protagonist fills their fifth Memory Counter, they clear it and may advance any number of Aspects, Connections, and Agendas related to the cleared Memories. To advance a Trait, update it to reflect changes to a protagonist's goals, personality, and relationships.

When a protagonist advances a Trait, they gain a benefit depending on that Trait.

## **Aspects**

Each protagonist has three Aspects, which are assigned at creation. Aspects are Permanent, Neutral Traits that express core truths about the character. The three Aspects are:

* **Mask.** How the protagonist presents themselves or how they are perceived. Masks reflect public identity, self-image, persona, and general reputation.  
* **Heart.** What the protagonist holds most dear or who they truly are, their passions and authentic self.  
* **Shadow.** The part of the protagonist that they hide or suppress: fears, resentment, inconvenient desire, weaknesses, or dangerous impulses.

### **Compelling Aspects**

The referee may attempt to compel a protagonist’s Aspects. This works like a typical Trait compel, but the protagonist’s player may refuse the offered compel. If they refuse, they gain 1d10 Corruption.

### **Advancing Aspects**

When an Aspect advances, they gain one rank in a Magical Affinity of their choice.

## **Connections**

A Connection is a Permanent Neutral Trait describing the relationship between one protagonist and another. All protagonists begin play with a Connection to each other protagonist.

Connections may be Positive, Negative, or Neutral Traits.

### **Bonus Hope**

When a protagonist's Hope Refreshes, they gain 1 Temporary Hope for each Negative Connection they have to other protagonists.

Protagonists do not benefit from Negative Connections to non-protagonist characters.

### **Advancing Connections**

When a Connection advances, the protagonist gains \+1 Affinity to the target of that Connection.

The alignment of the Connection changes based on the Memories associated with that advancement (see Advancement).

* If the Memories are mostly positive, the Connection moves one step towards Positive (a Negative Connection becomes Neutral; a Neutral Connection becomes Positive).  
* If the Memories are mostly negative, the Connection moves one step towards Negative (a Positive Connection becomes Neutral; a Neutral Connection becomes Negative).  
* If the Memories are mostly neutral or there is an equal mix, the Connection remains unchanged.

## **Agendas**

Agendas are Permanent Neutral Traits representing a protagonist’s personal goals. Agendas may be specific or broad personal priorities that drive action.

Each protagonist starts with two Agendas.

### **Gaining Agendas**

At each Major Milestone, a protagonist may create a new Agenda. A protagonist may have a maximum of five Agendas at any one time.

### **Advancing Agendas**

When an Agenda advances, the protagonist may choose one of the following benefits:

* The protagonist gains one rank in an Affinity related to the goal of that Agenda. The Affinity may be chosen from any Affinity list except Conviction or Tendency.  
* The protagonist gains a new Anchor related to the Agenda.  
* The protagonist clears a Lingering Wound. Only choose this option if the Agenda was dedicated to clearing that Lingering Wound.

### **Completing Agendas**

Unlike Aspects or Connections, Agendas often reach clear narrative conclusions. When an Agenda advances after reaching its narrative conclusion, replace it with a new one.

## **Anchors**

Anchors are Permanent Neutral Traits that keep a protagonist grounded and tethered to the mundane world, for good or for ill. They can be leveraged to counterbalance the seductive pull of magic, trauma, and dwindling will.

Anchors must not be magical in nature. Common Anchors include:

* Significant relationships with non-protagonist characters (platonic, familial, romantic, complicated, or antagonistic)  
* Membership in a club, workplace, team, community group, or gang.  
* Meaningful activities, hobbies, belief systems, or long-term commitments.

### **Gaining Anchors**

Protagonists start the game with two Anchors. They may also transform an Agenda into an Anchor when they advance that Agenda.

A protagonist may have up to five Anchors at any time. If they would gain a sixth Anchor, they must choose an Anchor to give up. Any Memories that would be lost due to this are moved to the new Anchor.

### **Clearing Corruption**

When a protagonist compels an Anchor, they may choose to gain 1 Hope as normal or instead clear 1 Corruption slot.

### **Flashbacks**

Once per Major Milestone, a protagonist may initiate a Flashback related to one of their Anchors. This does not require an Action.

When initiating a Flashback, the protagonist proposes a topic, mood, or theme related to that Anchor. The referee then frames a short scene depicting a meaningful moment between the protagonist and their Anchor in the past.

At the completion of the Flashback, the protagonist clears up to five filled Corruption slots.

## **Affinities**

Affinities are Permanent Neutral Traits representing a protagonist’s mundane or magical specializations, specific knowledge, and training. They are more specific than Skills, referring to specific subjects or courses of action.

A protagonist may have any number of Affinities and they gain a variable number at protagonist creation. They also gain them from various sources throughout play.

### **Affinity Ranks**

Unlike other Traits, a protagonist can gain the same Affinity multiple times. When a protagonist gains an Affinity, they gain a rank in it. For example, when a protagonist gains their first rank in Science Affinity, their rank in Science is 1\. If they were to gain Science Affinity again, they would become rank 2\. 

### **Free Invokes**

Protagonists gain 1 free invokes for an Affinity at ranks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\.

| Affinity Rank | Free Invokes |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | 0 |
| 2-3 | 1 |
| 4-5 | 2 |
| 6-7 | 3 |
| 8-9 | 4 |
| 10 | 5 |

Protagonists refresh their free Affinity invokes at each Minor Milestone.
