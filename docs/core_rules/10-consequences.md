# Despair

Despair represents the physical strain, psychological pressure, and emotional exhaustion a protagonist accumulates during their adventures. It is their primary damage track. A protagonist is not directly injured as they accumulate Despair, but it pushes them towards harmful states and may eventually lead to lasting Wounds.

Each protagonist has a 10 slot Despair Counter. Whenever they suffer Despair, they must either absorb it with a combination of Despair and Moods.

## **Clearing Despair**

Filled Despair slots may be cleared in several ways. At a Major Milestone, each protagonist clears all filled Despair slots. At a Minor Milestone, a protagonist may spend any number of their Hope points to clear one Despair slot per point of Hope spent (no Action required).

In addition, a protagonist may use a Bolster Action to attempt to relieve the Despair of another protagonist. On a success, the protagonist clears filled slots worth up to 1d10 Despair.

## **Fragile State**

When a protagonist fills their fifth Despair slot, they become Fragile. While Fragile, the results of a protagonist’s successes are mitigated. Critical Hits become Hits, Hits become Grazes, and Grazes become Misses.

## **Broken State**

When a protagonist fills their tenth Despair slot, they become Broken. While Broken, a protagonist suffers three effects.

### **Greater Mitigation**

The protagonist’s successes are further mitigated. Critical Hits become Grazes and all other results become Misses.

### **Hopelessness**

The protagonist is unable to spend Hope for any purpose, including to clear Despair at Minor Milestones.

A Broken protagonist may be rescued by having an ally compel their Connection to the Broken protagonist and giving up the Hope they would receive. In exchange, the Broken protagonist clears 5 of their filled Despair slots.

### **Vulnerability**

If a Broken protagonist would suffer Despair, they instead gain one Wound for each Despair slot they would have filled. For example, a Broken protagonist suffering 8 Despair suffers 2 Wounds.

# Wounds

Wounds represent the lasting repercussions of a protagonist reaching a breaking point, or suffering a lasting injury, trauma, or indignity. Unlike Despair or Moods, which model immediate strain, Wounds track enduring consequences.

Wounds are Temporary Negative Traits that apply a \-1B Circumstance penalty to all Checks using Abilities of the same category as the Wound. Wounds come in three types: Physical, Mental, or Social.

Wounds remain until they are cleared or they escalate into a Lingering Wound.

## **Suffering Wounds**

Wounds occur when suffering Despair while Broken or when suffering Fallout while taking an Action with high Stakes.

## **Recovery**

Wounds can be cleared with time and effort. At each Minor Milestone, each protagonist may attempt to clear one Wound of their choice by taking a Reaction with a Test corresponding to the Wound type:

* Physical Wounds \- Recovery (Vitality) Test  
* Mental Wounds \- Recovery (Resolve) Test  
* Social Wounds \- Recovery (Networking) Test

Failure does not confer any additional negative consequences besides missing the opportunity to clear a Wound.

Protagonists may also attempt to clear a Wound from themselves or allies by taking a Bolster Action. Physical and Mental Wounds can be cleared with a successful Bolster (Therapy) Check while Social Wounds can be cleared with a successful Bolster (Networking) Check.

## **Defeat**

A protagonist can suffer up to five Wounds total simultaneously. If a protagonist would exceed five Wounds, they are Defeated. Upon Defeat, the protagonist’s player chooses one of the following outcomes

### **Retirement**

The protagonist becomes unable to continue adventuring. They exit play and become a non-protagonist character under the referee’s control.

The story acknowledges their exit: disability, trauma, obligation, transformation, exile; whatever fits the fiction.

The player creates a new protagonist introduced at the next appropriate moment.

### **Vanishing**

The protagonist is lost completely and is functionally removed from the story. This may represent death, institutionalization, being abducted by monsters, fleeing the city after severe bullying, or being trapped or sealed away.

A vanished protagonist does not return unless both the referee and player explicitly agree.

### **Lingering Wound**

Instead of removal from the story, the protagonist may choose to gain a Lingering Wound, which is a Permanent Negative Trait. It matches the category of the last Wound received (Physical, Mental, or Emotional) before Defeat. The referee determines the specific narrative expression of this Trait.

Upon gaining the Lingering Wound, the protagonist is removed from the current scenario and returns at the next narrative opportunity or Minor Milestone. All non-Lingering Wounds the protagonist has of the same type as the Lingering Wound are cleared.

Lingering Wounds cannot be removed like ordinary Wounds. Instead, a protagonist can replace Reflecting on an Agenda during a Minor Milestone with Reflection on Recovering from their Wound. Upon the Lingering Wound gaining a third Memory, it is cleared.

# Moods

Moods are temporary states reflecting acute emotional or psychological instability. Each MOod corresponds to one Ability. Entering a Mood reduces incoming Despair at the cost of dramatically weakening that Ability for a time.

A protagonist may be in up to two Moods at any one time. They may not enter a third Mood until one is cleared.

## **Absorbing Despair with Moods**

When a protagonist suffers Despair, they may enter up to two Moods, each reducing Despair by an amount equal to their rank in the Ability associated with that Mood. This cannot reduce the amount of Despair received below 0\.

For example, a protagonist with Might 6 that enters the Weary Mood reduces the incoming Despair by 6\. Any remaining Despair must be absorbed with Despair slots.

## **Effects of Moods**

While in a Mood, the protagonist’s associated Ability is impaired. While making Checks using the associated Ability, the protagonist does not add their Ability die or Skill modifier to the Check. The protagonist still benefits from Circumstance Boons and Advantage die.

When making a Test while in a Mood, the protagonist’s Reaction score for the Skills associated with that Ability becomes 5\.

## **Ending Moods**

A protagonist may end a Mood they’re in by compelling it. To compel a Mood, the protagonist “leans into” it. Like other compels, this behavior must meaningfully worsen the situation. Once compelled, the Mood immediately ends.

Unlike compelling a Trait, Mood compels do not regain Hope.

## **Mood Descriptions**

### **Weary (Might)**

Drained, depleted, physically and spiritually exhausted.

Example compels: dropping something heavy, staggering, fainting, needing a nap.

### **Nervous (Grace)**

Jittery, unsteady, shaky, overly cautious.

Example compels: fumbling an object, hesitating at the wrong moment, misstepping.

### **Sensitive (Endurance)**

Fragile, raw, emotionally thin-skinned, near breaking.

Example compels: crying, lashing out, taking offense at nothing.

### **Obstinate (Intellect)**

Closed-minded, stubborn, refusing logic or analysis.

Example compels: dismissing a workable plan, refusing to consider evidence, making emotional arguments when facts are needed.

### **Distracted (Cunning)**

Unfocused, oblivious, preoccupied by obsessive thoughts.

Example compels: ignoring something vital, fixating on irrelevant detail, reacting too slow.

### **Reckless (Will)**

Impulsive, overcommitted, heedless of danger.

Example compels: taking an unnecessary risk, diving in without preparation.

### **Insecure (Confidence)**

Unsure, timid, fading into the background, losing assertiveness.

Example compels: yielding the spotlight, refusing to speak up, freezing with stage fright.

### **Irritated (Guile)**

Impatient, blunt, unable to maintain subtlety or deception.

Example compels: snapping at someone, revealing too much, seething with rage

### **Sullen (Empathy)**

Withdrawn, numb, shut down emotionally.

Example compels: pulling away from others, refusing emotional connection.

# Corruption

Corruption represents spiritual erosion, magical contamination, and a loss of free will that threatens protagonists wielding magic.

Each protagonist has a Corruption Counter with 10 slots, each slot is worth 5 Corruption. Protagonists gain Corruption by using magic or by refusing Aspect compels.

## **Reducing Corruption**

Protagonists can reduce their Corruption by compelling an Anchor. Whenever a protagonist compels an Anchor, instead of regaining Hope, they may clear one Corruption slot.

## **Effects of Corruption**

Gaining Corruption has no impact during a session. Instead, it only begins to impact protagonists after Milestones.

The referee gets a Temptation for each protagonist that reaches a Minor Milestone with at least 5 filled Corruption slots.

For each protagonist that reaches a Major Milestone with at least 1 filled Corruption slot, the referee gains a Corruption Fallout which they can use against that protagonist before the next Major Milestone. The severity of this Corruption Fallout depends on the level of Corruption. It may be Minor, Major, or Severe.

The Referee Guide has more information about using Temptations and Corruption Fallout against protagonists.

## **Consumed**

A protagonist that gains Corruption while already having 10 filled Corruption slot becomes Consumed until the next Minor Milestone, at which point they choose one of the following options. Once they choose an option, they clear 5 filled Corruption slots.

### **Burn Anchor**

The protagonist permanently loses one of their Anchors. At the next narrative opportunity, or via a Flashback, the referee and player reveal how that tie was destroyed. If a protagonist would lose the final Anchor in this way, they cannot choose this option.

### **Drain Memories**

The protagonist chooses five Memories from among their Aspects, Connections, or Agendas. They lose each chosen Memory. The protagonist cannot choose this option if they do not have at least five Memories amongst their Traits.

### **Dramatic Confrontation**

The protagonist’s Corruption erupts violently. The remaining protagonists face opposition with a 10-slot Progress Counter.

If the group overcomes this opposition, the Consumed protagonist is saved and their Temptation points are lost.

If the remaining protagonists yield or are Defeated, the Consumed protagonist must choose the Fall to Darkness option instead.

### **Fall to Darkness**

The protagonist is lost. They are retired (as if Defeated) but they become a Signbearer under the referee’s control. They may create a new protagonist at the next Minor Milestone.
