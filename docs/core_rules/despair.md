# Despair

Despair represents the physical strain, psychological pressure, and emotional exhaustion a protagonist accumulates during their adventures. It is their primary damage track. A protagonist is not directly injured as they accumulate Despair, but it pushes them towards harmful states and may eventually lead to lasting Wounds.

Each protagonist has a 10 slot Despair Counter. Whenever they suffer Despair, they must either absorb it with a combination of Despair and Moods.

## Clearing Despair

Filled Despair slots may be cleared in several ways. At a Major Milestone, each protagonist clears all filled Despair slots. At a Minor Milestone, a protagonist may spend any number of their Hope points to clear one Despair slot per point of Hope spent (no Action required).

In addition, a protagonist may use a Bolster Action to attempt to relieve the Despair of another protagonist. On a success, the protagonist clears filled slots worth up to 1d10 Despair.

## Fragile State

When a protagonist fills their fifth Despair slot, they become Fragile. While Fragile, the results of a protagonist’s successes are mitigated. Critical Hits become Hits, Hits become Grazes, and Grazes become Misses.

## Broken State

When a protagonist fills their tenth Despair slot, they become Broken. While Broken, a protagonist suffers three effects.

### Greater Mitigation

The protagonist’s successes are further mitigated. Critical Hits become Grazes and all other results become Misses.

### Hopelessness

The protagonist is unable to spend Hope for any purpose, including to clear Despair at Minor Milestones.

A Broken protagonist may be rescued by having an ally compel their Connection to the Broken protagonist and giving up the Hope they would receive. In exchange, the Broken protagonist clears 5 of their filled Despair slots.

### Vulnerability

If a Broken protagonist would suffer Despair, they instead gain a Wound with a number of ranks equal to the number of Despair slots they would have filled. The Wound is of the same type as the source of the Despair. For example, a Broken protagonist suffering 8 Despair from a physical source suffers a rank 2 Physical Wound. See Wounds below for more information.
