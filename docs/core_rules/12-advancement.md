# Advancement

## **Minor Milestones**

A Minor Milestone occurs at the end of every session. The referee may apply it immediately or at the start of the next session.

At a Minor Milestone, each protagonist does the follow:

1. Refresh Affinity free invokes  
2. Attempt to heal one Wound by making a Recovery Test  
3. Spend Hope to clear Despair  
4. Protagonists may then reflect on their Traits  
5. Protagonists note their number of filled Corruption slots for the referee if they are above 5

### **Reflection**

At each Minor Milestone, protagonists may choose up to one of each of their Aspects, Agendas, and Connections. For each chosen Trait, that protagonist explains how that Trait was meaningfully expressed or challenged in the preceding session.

### **Memories**

Each Trait reflected upon gains a Memory that summarizes that Reflection. Aspects, Agendas, and Connections can have up to 3 Memories. Once a third Memory is added, clear the memories and advance the Trait. When a Trait Advances, the protagonist gains an Affinity representing their growth.

## **Major Milestones**

A Major Milestone occurs at the end of the last session in a story arc, as determined by the referee. A Major Milestone typically occurs every 3-5 sessions. At a Major Milestone, each protagonist benefits from a Minor Milestone and then:

1. Clears all filled Despair slots  
2. Refreshes their Hope  
3. Refreshes their Effort  
4. Gain a Class Feature of their choice (see Classes)  
5. Gain a Charm of their choice (see Charms)  
6. Increase Skill ranks by spending SP  
7. Gain Talents by spending XP  
8. Protagonists note their number of filled Corruption slots for the referee

### **Gaining Skill Ranks**

At each Major Milestone, protagonists may spend any amount of accrued SP to increase Skill ranks. To increase a Skill rank, you must spend 5 times the desired rank. SP must be paid for each rank sequentially.

For example, a protagonist that wishes to increase their Craft Skill rank from 3 to 5 must first spend 20 SP to increase their rank to 4\. They may then spend 25 SP to increase it to 5\. They would need to spend a total of 45\.
