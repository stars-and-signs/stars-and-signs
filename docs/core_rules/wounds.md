# Wounds

Wounds represent the lasting repercussions of a protagonist reaching a breaking point, or suffering a lasting injury, trauma, or indignity. Unlike Despair, which models immediate strain, Wounds track enduring consequences. Wounds come in three types: Physical, Mental, or Social.

Wounds are Temporary Negative Traits that, like other such Traits, confer -1B Circumstance to Checks made using Abilities of the same type (Physical Wounds affect Checks made using Might, Grace, or Endurance Skills, for example).

In addition to the typical features of a Trait and a type, each Wound possesses a rank of 1 or higher. Wounds confer an additional \-1B Circumstance for each rank above 1. For example, a rank 3 Mental Wound confers -3B Circumstance to Checks made using Mental Skills.

Wounds remain until they are cleared.

## **Suffering Wounds**

Wounds occur when suffering Despair while Broken or when suffering Fallout while taking an Action or Reaction with high Stakes.

## **Recovery**

Wounds can be cleared through use of the Bolster Action. A protagonist can atttempt to clear their own Wounds or the Wounds of another protagonist in this way. Clearing a Wound has a Potency equal to the Wound's rank. The Skill used for clearing a Wound with an Action depends on the Wound's type \- Physical and Mental Wounds can be cleared with a successful Bolster (Therapy) Check while Social Wounds can be cleared with a successful Bolster (Networking) Action.

Protagonists may be able to recover from their Wounds automatically over time. At each Minor Milestone, each protagonist may attempt to clear one Wound of their choice by taking a Recovery Reaction with a Test corresponding to the Wound type:

* Physical Wounds \- Recovery (Vitality) Test  
* Mental Wounds \- Recovery (Resolve) Test  
* Social Wounds \- Recovery (Networking) Test

The protagonist's Reaction must still meet the corresponding Potency for the Wound. Failure does not confer any additional negative consequences besides missing the opportunity to clear a Wound.

To clear Wounds with high Potency, a protagonist may need to take Extended Actions. Wounds have a Healing Progress Counter with a number of slots equal to its Potency. A protagonist may progress this Counter with a successful Aciton or Reaction if that Action or Reaction has a Potency of at least one less than the Potency of the Wound. For example, a rank 4 Physical Wound has 4 Healing slots. Each slot is filled with a successful Bolster (Therapy) Action or Recovery (Vitality) Reaction. 

## **Defeat**

A protagonist that would gain more than 5 total ranks of Wounds simultaneously is Defeated. Upon Defeat, the protagonist’s player chooses one of the following outcomes

### **Retirement**

The protagonist becomes unable to continue adventuring. They exit play and become a non-protagonist character under the referee’s control.

The story acknowledges their exit: disability, trauma, obligation, transformation, exile; whatever fits the fiction.

The player creates a new protagonist introduced at the next appropriate moment.

### **Vanishing**

The protagonist is lost completely and is functionally removed from the story. This may represent death, institutionalization, being abducted by monsters, fleeing the city after severe bullying, or being trapped or sealed away.

A vanished protagonist does not return unless both the referee and player explicitly agree.

### **Lingering Wound**

Instead of removal from the story, the protagonist may choose to gain a new Permanent Negative Trait related to their highest ranking Wound (the referee chooses one on a tie). This Trait may only be removed by creating an Agenda dedicated to doing so.
