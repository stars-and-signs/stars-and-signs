# Moods

Moods are temporary states reflecting acute emotional or psychological instability. Each MOod corresponds to one Ability. Entering a Mood reduces incoming Despair at the cost of dramatically weakening that Ability for a time.

A protagonist may be in up to two Moods at any one time. They may not enter a third Mood until one is cleared.

## Absorbing Despair with Moods

When a protagonist suffers Despair, they may enter up to two Moods, each reducing Despair by an amount equal to their rank in the Ability associated with that Mood. This cannot reduce the amount of Despair received below 0\.

For example, a protagonist with Might 6 that enters the Weary Mood reduces the incoming Despair by 6\. Any remaining Despair must be absorbed with Despair slots.

## Effects of Moods

While in a Mood, the protagonist’s associated Ability is impaired. While making Checks using the associated Ability, the protagonist does not add their Ability die or Skill modifier to the Check. The protagonist still benefits from Circumstance Boons and Advantage die.

When making a Test while in a Mood, the protagonist’s Reaction score for the Skills associated with that Ability becomes 5\.

## Ending Moods

A protagonist may end a Mood they’re in by compelling it. To compel a Mood, the protagonist “leans into” it. Like other compels, this behavior must meaningfully worsen the situation. Once compelled, the Mood immediately ends.

Unlike compelling a Trait, Mood compels do not regain Hope.
