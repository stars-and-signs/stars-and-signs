# Traits

Traits are short, descriptive statements attached to a character, location, object, scene, or concept.

## **Trait Duration**

Traits exist in two forms: Temporary or Permanent.

Temporary Traits are created by Actions or circumstance. They persist until something in the fiction negates or resolves them. They often represent situational advantages, imposed conditions, or transient states. Examples include: \[Pinned Under Rubble\], \[Distracted\], \[Illuminated by a Spotlight\].

Permanent Traits represent inherent, defining qualities. They persist unless explicitly removed or altered.

## **Trait Alignment**

Each Trait has an alignment that governs how it influences checks. Traits can be Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

### **Neutral Traits**

Neutral Traits have no inherent mechanical bonuses or penalties but they may be invoked or compelled.

### **Positive Traits**

Actions and Reactions relevant to a Positive Trait gain \+1B Circumstance (for Checks) or \-1B Difficulty (for Tests). A Positive Trait may still be invoked or compelled.

### **Negative Traits**

Actions and Reactions relevant to a Negative Trait suffer \-1B Circumstance (for Checks) or \+1B Difficulty (for Tests). A Negative Trait may still be invoked in rare circumstances where it can be turned to a protagonist’s advantage.

## **Invoking Traits**

Invoking Traits is the primary way that protagonists convert their narrative positioning into mechanical leverage. When a protagonist performs an Action or Reaction related to a Trait, they may invoke that Trait by spending 1 Hope.

When a protagonist invokes a Trait, they choose one of the following benefits:

* **Circumstance Boon.** \+1B Circumstance on the Check. This option must be chosen before the Check is made.  
* **Advantage Die.** The protagonist adds an additional d10 to their result, called an Advantage die. This option can only be chosen after the Check is made and only if the Check was a success (a result of at least 10). If the protagonist already has an Advantage die for the Check (such as from another invoked Trait), they instead gain \+1B Advantage. This option may be chosen before or after the Check is rolled.

Any number of different relevant Traits may be invoked on the same Check but a Trait may be invoked up to once per Check

## **Free Invokes**

Some Positive or Neutral Traits possess free invokes, which protagonists can expend instead of Hope to invoke that Trait. Each free invoke allows one invocation of the Trait without cost.

## **Compelling Traits**

A protagonist may compel a Trait to clear 1 filled Hope slot. To compel a Trait, a protagonist must take an Action or make a choice that significantly complicates their situation. The complication must be meaningful enough to merit Fallout from the referee and the Trait must reasonably justify the complication.

## **Creating Traits**

Protagonists often create Temporary Traits through successful Actions during play. Traits created this way are Neutral and come with one free invoke, which the creating protagonist may use or give to any other protagonist.

Many features enhance created Triats by adding extra free invokes, granting additional effects when invoked, or upgrading their alignment to Positive.
