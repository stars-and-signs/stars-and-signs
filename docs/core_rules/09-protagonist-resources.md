# Effort

Effort represents a protagonist’s capacity to push themselves beyond their normal limits \- physical exertion, mental strain, or emotional resolve. It is a finite resource stored in three point pools, corresponding to the three Ability categories.

## **Effort Types**

Each protagonist has three Effort pools:

* **Blood.** Tied to Physical Abilities (Might, Grace, Endurance)  
* **Sweat.** Tied to Mental Abilities (Intellect, Cunning, Will)  
* **Tears.** Tied to Emotional Abilities (Confidence, Guile, Empathy)

## **Spending Effort**

When a protagonist makes a Check, after seeing the result, they may spend up to 5 Effort from the pool associated with the Ability used for that check. For each point of Effort spent, the protagonist gains \+1 to that Check’s result.

## **Regaining and Refreshing Effort**

The maximum number of points a protagonist can have in each of their Effort pools is determined by the protagonist’s ranks in the associated Abilities. This number is referred to as their Refresh. For example, a protagonist with 5 ranks in Might, 4 ranks in Grace, and 2 ranks in Endurance has 11 Blood Refresh.

Protagonists regain Effort by compelling Skills, as described in the Skills section.

At each Major Milestone, a protagonist’s Effort resets to the corresponding Refresh value. Protagonists 

## **Gaining Skill Points**

Whenever a protagonist regains Effort through either a Skill compel or Refresh, they also gain an equal number of Skill Points (SP).

# Hope

Hope is an abstract representation of what makes a protagonist truly special: their courage, optimism, and conviction. Hope fuels Trait invocations and certain features.

## **Spending Hope**

Protagonists can spend Hope to invoke Traits. Some features provide additional uses for Hope. Hope can also be spent to decrease a protagonist’s Despair (see Despair).

## **Refreshing and Regaining Hope**

Each protagonist has a pool of 5 Hope points, which is their Hope Refresh. At each Major Milestone, a protagonist resets their number of Hope points to their Hope Refresh. Protagonists can also regain Hope by compelling Traits.

Protagonists may increase their Hope Refresh by gaining Negative Connections to other protagonists.
