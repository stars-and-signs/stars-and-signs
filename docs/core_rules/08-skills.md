# Skills

While Abilities represent more broad aptitudes in groupings of tasks, Skills represent more specific, practiced competencies. Skills describe the approach you’re taking to an Action.

Every Ability has three associated Skills, giving each protagonist a total of 27 Skills.

## **Skill Ranks**

Each protagonist starts with 0 ranks in every Skill unless they gain ranks in that Skill during protagonist creation. Ranks may be increased at Major Milestones by spending Skill Points (SP).

## **Skill Modifiers**

A Skill’s rank determines its modifier, which is added to the result of a Check that uses that Skill.

| Skill Rank | Skill Modifier |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | \+0 |
| 1-2 | \+1 |
| 3-4 | \+2 |
| 5-6 | \+3 |
| 7-8 | \+4 |
| 9-10 | \+5 |

Up to one Skill modifier may be added to a Check at a time.

## **Compelling**

Protagonists may compel their Skills, similar to Traits, to regain Effort (see Effort). Compelling a Skill requires acting in a way that meaningfully complicates their life.

When a protagonist compels a Skill, they regain an amount of Effort of the corresponding type equal to their modifier in that Skill.

Examples:

* A highly knowledgeable analyst compelling Logic to overthink a simple situation.  
* A trained soldier compelling Violence to not back down from a duel.  
* A sensitive therapist compelling Insight to become overwhelmed by other’s emotions.
