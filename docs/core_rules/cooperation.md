# Cooperation

When two or more protagonists attempt something together and the entire group will either succeed or fail as a unit, they perform a Cooperation Check. A Cooperation Check has three steps:

1. Choose a Leader  
2. Followers choose their method of supporting and make a Test  
3. The Leader makes a Check to determine the group’s success, with modifiers from the Follower’s outcomes

## Leader

The group designates one protagonist as the Leader, which identifies whose Check will determine the group’s collective outcome.

The Leader is responsible for:

* Describing the group’s shared intent as a single Action  
* Determining the method they personally use  
* Making the final Check  
* Choosing Cost types and distributing the effects of Fallout, if appropriate

## Followers

All other participants in a Cooperation Check become Followers. Each Follower describes how they’re helping the group’s efforts.

Once  their method is chosen, each Follower makes a Support Test. Each Follower that succeeds grants \+2 to the Leader’s Check. Each Follower that fails grants \-2 to the Leader’s Check.

## Collective Check

After the Followers have made their Tests and the cumulative Cooperation modifier is calculated, the Leader makes a Check, as normal, adding the Cooperation modifier to the result.

## Shared Fallout

Cooperation spreads both benefits and risks. If the Leader’s Check results in:

* Each member of the group pays any Costs or suffers any Fallout.  
* The referee uses one Complication for the whole group.
