# Actions

In Stars & Signs, every attempt to change the situation or act on opposition is an Action. Actions are defined by the intent behind them, not the methods used. Two protagonists might take different approaches \- violence, intimidation, or magical control \- but if their goals are the same, they’re taking the same Action type.

## **Declaring an Action**

When a player describes what their protagonist is aiming to accomplish, the referee identifies the Action type that best fits the intended outcome. If the referee’s interpretation doesn’t match the player’s intent, the two refine the description until they both agree on the Action’s purpose.

Intent determines Action type. The method of Execution determines the Ability and Skill.

## **Action Types**

Each of the nine Action types is intentionally broad. They exist to classify outcomes, not to describe actions or narrative.

### **Eliminate**

To remove an obstacle, neutralize a threat, destroy an object, or otherwise take something out of play. While this may appear to be the most direct route to overall success, opposition often needs to be weakened or edges need to be gained to be able to tackle difficult goals.

**Examples:** knock out a guard, disable an explosive device, smash a reinforced lock.

### **Hinder**

To weaken the opposition's ability to act or resist.

**Examples:** grapple a cultist, throw sand in someone’s face, psychologically unbalance a suspect.

### **Bolster**

To improve someone’s position, well-being, or readiness.

**Examples:** shielding a civilian, giving a rousing pep-talk, healing Wounds or Stress.

### **Influence**

To change beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors through force of personality, well-argued facts, or social pressure.

**Examples:** debating philosophy, intimidating a bully into believing you’re a threat, flattering a rival into cooperation.

### **Obscure**

To hide something \- facts, objects, intentions, or yourself.

**Examples:** lying convincingly, staying out of sight, concealing contraband on your person.

### **Create**

To construct, assemble, fashion, or generate something new and lasting.

**Examples:** forging a tool, designing a new magical ritual, building a friendship.

### **Utilize**

To make use of a resource, tool, connection, or edge already available.

**Examples:** accessing secured databases, calling in a favor, channeling energy from an artifact.

### **Discover**

To gather information not currently known.

**Examples:** researching an enemy, reading a room, tracking a missing person, analyzing mystical residue.

### **Transport**

To move a person, including yourself, or object through space under adverse conditions.

**Examples:** pulling an ally from danger, navigating a narrow cliffside, chasing down a suspect.

## **Action Type Triggers**

Features (Talents, Class Features, Charms, Assets, and others) often specify that they apply when a particular Action type is taken with a specific Skill. These appear as Action type (Skill). The Skill used determines the Ability that contributes the Ability die to the Action. For example:

* Eliminate (Violence) means using Might and Violence to Eliminate  
* Influence (Charisma) means using Confidence and Charisma to Influence  
* Transport (Agility) means using Grace and Agility to Transport

## **Determining the Ability and Skill Used**

After the Action type is established, the fictional method the protagonist is using determines which Ability and Skill apply. For example, two protagonists that want to Hinder a yokai:

* One protagonist throws a heavy object at its legs to trip it, they make a Might (Strength) check.  
* The other taunts it to break its concentration, they make a Guile (Manipulation) check.

Both are HInder Actions, but they use different Abilities and Skills based on the methods used.

## **Adjudicating Edge Cases**

Some situations fall between Action types. The referee should consider:

* Player intent  
* Consequences of success  
* Consequences of failure

Whichever Action type most accurately reflects the outcome is correct. When an Action would meaningfully accomplish more than one outcome, the referee may require separation Actions, or classify it by the dominant effect.

For example, setting off fireworks to distract guards while creating cover for allies:

* If the goal is to let allies pass unseen, the Action is Obscure.  
* If the goal is to unnerve and surprise the guard, the Action is Hinder.  
* If the fireworks serve as both, the referee may request multiple Actions for each objective.

# Checks

A Check is the fundamental resolution mechanic of Stars & Signs. Whenever a protagonist attempts something that could reasonably fail, they make a Check. Checks combine Circumstance dice, an Ability die, and any additional dice from Advantages or other features to produce a single numerical result. The result then determines failure or the degree of success.

## **When to Call for a Check**

The referee calls for a Check only when both of the following conditions apply:

1. There’s uncertainty. Success or failure is not guaranteed by common sense or narrative positioning.  
2. There’s repercussions. Failure matters and meaningfully alters the situation.

If the Action is trivial, rote, or unopposed, don’t roll. Conversely, if success is impossible, even under perfect execution, don’t roll.

## **Parts of a Check**

To construct the dice pool for a check:

1. Start with the Circumstance dice, which is 2d10  
2. Then add the most applicable Ability die and the protagonist’s modifier in the corresponding Skill, if any.  
3. Then add any additional dice or modifiers from Advantages and other features.  
4. Apply Boons and Banes to the corresponding dice then roll the pool. Apply the rules for Boons and Banes by dropping dice, as appropriate.  
5. Sum the remaining dice to get the result. The total is the Check’s result.

## **Interpreting the Result**

To determine if an Action is a failure or the degree of success, compare the Check’s total to the following fixed resolution bands.

### **Miss (\< 10\)**

The protagonist’s attempt fails. They do not achieve their goal cleanly and the referee applies Fallout. Fallout may:

* Block the goal outright, or  
* Allow partial success with a significant drawback

In addition to Fallout, the referee introduces a Complication.

### **Graze (10-14)**

The protagonist achieves their intent, but must pay a Cost to do so. There are three types of Costs: Personal, Impact, or Opportunity. The protagonist chooses the type of Cost they pay, but the referee determines its exact nature. Costs should never fully negate the benefits of a protagonist’s success.

The Cost types are:

* **Personal Costs.** The acting protagonist suffers Stress, loses access to an Asset, or one of their NPC relationships is damaged.  
* **Impact Costs.** The effects of the success are mitigated or delayed. If the Action would result in an Extra, it may be lost to fulfill this cost.  
* **Opportunity Costs.** The protagonist is put into a worse position, they potentially get a Temporary Negative Trait,  lose a Temporary Positive Trait, or increase the Stakes of the Action.

In addition to the Cost, the referee introduces a Complication.

### **Hit (15-19)**

The protagonist scores an unambiguous success. They accomplish what they set out to do without cost, but the referee still has an opportunity to introduce a Complication.

### **Critical Hit (20+)**

A superior success. The protagonist not only accomplishes their goal, their Action gains \+1 Scale. Scale improves the magnitude, reach, or durability of the result, depending on the context.

Unless the Critical Hit results in an Extra that skips it, the referee then introduces a Complication.
