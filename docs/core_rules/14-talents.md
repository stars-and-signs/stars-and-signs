## **Talents**

Talents are special features that enhance protagonist capabilities in ways other than sheer numerical bonuses. There are a wide range of Talents with varying requirements and benefits.

### **Talent Slots and Gaining Talents**

Each Skill has five Talent slots, which are unlocked at Skill ranks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Each slot can hold up to one Talent associated with that Skill. At each Minor Milestone, a protagonist may choose any number of Talents to fill their unoccupied Talent slots.

### **Ability Rank Increase**

Talents increase protagonist Ability ranks. When a Talent is placed into a slot for a Skill, they increase their rank in the Ability associated with that Skill by 1 (to a maximum of 10).

### **Repeating Talents**

Most Talents may only be taken once. Some Talents specify that they may be taken multiple times and may offer multiple options that may be taken each time.
